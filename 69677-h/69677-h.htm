</div>

<p>My right to speak for the man in the street,
the average American, is, I am aware, open to
serious question. Possibly there are amiable
persons who, if urged to pass judgment, would
appraise me a trifle higher than the average;
others, I am painfully aware, would rate me
much lower. The point is, of course, one about
which I am not entitled to an opinion. I offer
no apology for the apparent unrelated character
of the subjects herein discussed, for to my mind
the volume has a certain cohesion. In that
part of America with which I am most familiar,
literature, politics, religion, and the changing
social scene are all of a piece. We disport ourselves
in one field as blithely as in another.
Within a few blocks of this room, on the fifteenth
floor of an office-building in the centre of my
home town, I can find men and women quite
competent to answer questions pertaining to
any branch of philosophy or the arts. I called
a lawyer friend on the telephone only yesterday<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span>
and hummed a few bars of music that he might
aid me with the correct designation of one of
Beethoven’s symphonies. In perplexity over
an elusive quotation I can, with all confidence,
plant myself on the post-office steps and some
one will come along with the answer. I do
not mention these matters boastfully, but
merely to illustrate the happy conditions of
life in the delectable province in which I was
born.</p>

<p>The papers here collected first appeared
in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, except “Let Main
Street Alone!” which was published in the
New York <i>Evening Post</i>, “The Cheerful Breakfast
Table,” which is reprinted from the <i>Yale
Review</i>, and “The Poor Old English Language,”
which is reproduced from <i>Scribner’s Magazine</i>.
The political articles are sufficiently explained
by their dates. They are reprinted without
alteration in the hope that some later student
of the periods scrutinized may find them of
interest.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">CERTAIN questions lie dormant for long
periods and then, often with no apparent
provocation, assume an acute phase and
cry insistently for attention. The failure of the
church to adjust itself to the needs of the age;
the shiftlessness of the new generation; the
weaknesses of our educational system—these
and like matters are susceptible of endless debate.
Into this general classification we may
gaily sweep the query as to whether a small
town is as promising a habitat for an aspiring
soul as a large city. When we have wearied
of defending or opposing the continuance of the
direct primary, or have found ourselves suddenly
conscious that the attempt to decide
whether immortality is desirable is unprofitable,
we may address ourselves valiantly to a
discussion of the advantages of the provinces
over those of the seething metropolis, or take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
the other way round, as pleases our humor.
Without the recurring stimulus of such contentions
as these we should probably be driven to
the peddling of petty gossip or sink into a state
of intellectual coma.</p>

<p>There are encouraging signs that we of this
Republic are much less impatient under criticism
than we used to be, or possibly we are
becoming more callous. Still I think it may be
said honestly that we have reached a point
where we are measurably disposed to see American
life steadily and see it whole. It is the seeing
it whole that is the continuing difficulty.
We have been reminded frequently that our
life is so varied that the great American novel
must inevitably be the work of many hands, it
being impossible for one writer to present more
than one phase or describe more than one geographical
section. This is “old stuff,” and nothing
that need keep us awake o’ nights. One of
these days some daring hand capable of wielding
a broad brush will paint a big picture, but
meanwhile we are not so badly served by those
fictionists who turn up their little spadefuls of
earth and clap a microscope upon it. Such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
novels as <i>Miss Lulu Bett</i> and <i>Main Street</i> or
such a play as Mr. Frank Craven’s <i>The First
Year</i>, to take recent examples, encourage the
hope that after all we are not afraid to look at
ourselves when the mirror is held before us by
a steady hand.</p>

<p>A serious novel that cuts close to the quick
can hardly fail to disclose one of our most amusing
weaknesses—our deeply ingrained local
pride that makes us extremely sensitive to criticism
in any form of our own bailiwick. The
nation may be assailed and we are philosophical
about it; but if our home town is peppered with
bird shot by some impious huntsman we are at
once ready for battle. We do like to brag of our
own particular Main Street! It is in the blood of
the provincial American to think himself more
happily situated and of a higher type than the
citizens of any other province. In journeys
across the continent, I have sometimes thought
that there must be a definite line where bragging
begins. I should fix it somewhere west of Pittsburgh,
attaining its maximum of innocent complacency
in Indiana, diminishing through Iowa
and Nebraska, though ranging high in Kansas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
and Colorado and there gathering fresh
power for a dash to the coast, where stout
Cortez and all his men would indeed look at
each other with a mild surmise to hear the children
of the Pacific boast of their landscape and
their climate, and the kindly fruits of their soil.</p>

<p>When I travel beyond my State’s boundaries
I more or less consciously look for proof of
Indiana’s superiority. Where I fail to find it I
am not without my explanations and excuses.
If I should be kidnapped and set down blindfolded
in the midst of Ohio on a rainy night, I
should know, I am sure, that I was on alien
soil. I frequently cross Iowa, Kansas, and Nebraska,
and never without a sense of a change
of atmosphere in passing from one to the other.
Kansas, from territorial days, has been much
more strenuously advertised than Nebraska.
The very name Kansas is richer in its connotations.
To think of it is to recall instantly the
days of border warfare; John Brown of Osawatomie,
the New England infusion, the Civil
War soldiers who established themselves on the
free soil after Appomattox; grasshoppers and
the days of famine; populism and the Sockless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
Socrates of Medicine Lodge, the brilliant, satiric
Ingalls, Howe’s <i>Story of a Country Town</i>, William
Allen White of Emporia, and <i>A Certain
Rich Man</i>, down to and including the present
governor, the Honorable Henry J. Allen, beyond
question the most beguiling man to sit at
meat with in all America.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>A lady with whom I frequently exchange
opinions on the trolley-cars of my town took
me to task recently for commending Mr. Sinclair
Lewis’s <i>Main Street</i> as an achievement
worthy of all respect. “I know a score of Indiana
towns and they are not like Gopher Prairie,”
she declared indignantly. “No,” I conceded,
“they are not; but the Indiana towns
you have in mind are older than Gopher Prairie;
many of them have celebrated their centennial;
they were founded by well-seasoned
pioneers of the old American stocks; and an impressive
number of the first settlers—I named
half a dozen—experienced the same dismay and
disgust, and were inspired by the same noble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
ambition to make the world over that Mr. Lewis
has noted in Carol Kennicott’s case.”</p>

<p>Not one but many of my neighbors, and
friends and acquaintances in other towns, have
lately honored me with their views on provincial
life with Mr. Lewis’s novel as a text. Most
of them admit that Minnesota may be like that,
but by all the gods at once things are not so in
“my State” or “my town.” This is a habit of
thought, a state of mind. There is, I think, something
very delightful about it. To encounter it
is to be refreshed and uplifted. It is like meeting
a stranger who isn’t ashamed to boast of his
wife’s cooking. On east and west journeys across
the region of the tall corn one must be churlish
indeed to repel the man who is keen to enlighten
the ignorant as to the happy circumstances of
his life. After an hour I experience a pleasurable
sense of intimacy with his neighbors. If, when
his town is reached, I step out upon the platform
with the returning Ulysses, there may be
time enough to shake hands with his wife and
children, and I catch a glimpse of his son in the
waiting motor—(that boy, I’d have you know,
took all the honors of his class at our State<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
university)—and it is with real sorrow that I
confess my inability to stop off for a day or two
to inspect the grain-elevator and the new brickyard
and partake of a chicken dinner at the
country club—the snappiest in all this part of
the State! Main Street is proud of itself, and
any newcomer who assumes a critical attitude
or is swollen with a desire to retouch the lily is
doomed to a chilly reception.</p>

<p>My joy in <i>Main Street</i>, the book, is marred
by what I am constrained to think is a questionable
assertion in the foreword, namely:
“The town is, in our tale, called Gopher Prairie,
Minnesota. But its Main Street is the continuation
of Main Street everywhere. The story
would be the same in Ohio or Montana, in
Kansas or Kentucky or Illinois, and not very
differently would it be told up York State or in
the Carolina Hills.” Now I should say that
there are very marked differences between
Gopher Prairie and towns of approximately the
same size that have drawn upon different strains
of foreign or American stock. Mr. Lewis depicts
character with a sure stroke, and he communicates
the sense of atmosphere admirably.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
There are paragraphs and single lines that
arrest the attention and invite re-reading, so
sharply do they bite into the consciousness.
One pays him a reader’s highest tribute—“That’s
true; I’ve known just such people.”
But I should modify his claim to universality
in deference to the differences in local history
so clearly written upon our maps and the dissimilar
backgrounds of young America that are
not the less interesting or important because
the tracings upon them are so thin.</p>

<p>Human nature, we are frequently assured, is
the same the world over, but I don’t believe it
can be maintained successfully that all small
towns are alike. All manner of things contribute
to the making of a community. A college town
is unlike an industrial or a farming centre of the
same size. A Scandinavian influence in a community
is quite different from a German or an
Irish or a Scotch influence. There are places in
the heart of America where, in the formative
period, the Scotch-Irish exerted a very marked
influence indeed in giving tone and direction to
the community life, and the observer is sensible
of this a hundred years afterward. There are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
varied shadings traceable to early dominating
religious forces; Catholicism, Methodism, Presbyterianism,
and Episcopalianism each imparting
a coloring of its own to the social fabric.
No more fascinating field is open to the student
than that offered by the elements that have
contributed to the building of American communities
as, for example, where there has been
a strong foreign infusion or such a blend as that
of New Englanders with folk of a Southern
strain. Those who are curious in such matters
will find a considerable literature ready to their
hand. Hardly any one at all conversant with
American life but will think instantly of groups
of men and women who in some small centre
were able, by reason of their foresight and
courage, to lay a debt upon posterity, or of an
individual who has waged battle alone for
public betterment.</p>

<p>The trouble with Mr. Lewis’s Carol Kennicott
was that she really had nothing to offer Gopher
Prairie that sensible self-respecting people anywhere
would have welcomed. A superficial
creature, she was without true vision in any
direction. Plenty of men and women vastly her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
superior in cultivation and blessed with a far
finer sensitiveness to the things of the spirit
have in countless cases faced rude conditions,
squalor even, cheerfully and hopefully, and in
time they have succeeded in doing something
to make the world a better place to live in. This
is not to say that Carol is not true to type; there
is the type, but I am not persuaded that its
existence proves anything except that there are
always fools and foolish people in the world.
Carol would have been a failure anywhere. She
deserved to fail in Gopher Prairie, which does
not strike me, after all, as so hateful a place as
she found it to be. She nowhere impinges upon
my sympathy. I have known her by various
names in larger and lovelier communities than
Gopher Prairie, and wherever she exists she is
a bore, and at times an unmitigated nuisance.
My heart warms, not to her, but to the people
in Main Street she despised. They didn’t need
her uplifting hand! They were far more valuable
members of society than she proved herself to
be, for they worked honestly at their jobs and
had, I am confident, a pretty fair idea of their
rights and duties, their privileges and immunities,
as children of democracy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>Nothing in America is more reassuring than
the fact that some one is always wailing in the
market-place. When we’ve got something and
don’t like it, we wait for some one to tell us how
to get rid of it. Plunging into prohibition, we at
once become tolerant of the bootlegger. There’s
no point of rest. We are fickle, capricious, and
pine for change. In the course of time we score
for civilization, but the gains, broadly considered,
are small and painfully won. Happiest are
they who keep sawing wood and don’t expect
too much! There are always the zealous laborers,
the fit though few, who incur suspicion, awaken
antagonism, and suffer defeat, to pave the way
for those who will reap the harvest of their sowing.
There are a hundred million of us and it’s
too much to ask that we all chase the same rainbow.
There are diversities of gifts, but all, we
hope, animated by the same spirit.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>The Main Streets I know do not strike me as
a fit subject for commiseration. I refuse to be
sorry for them. I am increasingly impressed by
their intelligence, their praiseworthy curiosity
as to things of good report, their sturdy optimism,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
their unshakable ambition to excel other
Main Streets. There is, to be sure, a type of
village with a few stores, a blacksmith-shop,
and a gasolene station, that seems to express the
ultimate in torpor. Settlements of this sort may
be found in every State, and the older the State
the more complete seems to be their inertia.
But where five thousand people are assembled—or
better, when we deal with a metropolis of
ten or twelve thousand souls—we are at once
conscious of a pulse that keeps time with the
world’s heart-beat. There are compensations for
those who abide in such places. In such towns,
it is quite possible, if you are an amiable being,
to know well-nigh every one. The main thoroughfare
is a place of fascinations, the stage for
a continuing drama. Carrier delivery destroys
the old joy of meeting all the folks at the post-office,
but most of the citizens, male and female,
find some excuse for a daily visit to Main
Street. They are bound together by dear and
close ties. You’ve got to know your neighbors
whether you want to or not, and it’s well for
the health of your soul to know them and be of
use to them when you can.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>I should regard it as a calamity to be deprived
of the felicity of my occasional visits to a particular
centre of enlightenment and cheer that
I have in mind. An hour’s journey on the trolley
brings me to the court-house. After one such
visit the stranger needn’t trouble to enroll himself
at the inn; some one is bound to offer to put
him up. There is a dramatic club in that town
that produces good plays with remarkable skill
and effectiveness. The club is an old one as
such things go, and it fixes the social standard
for the community. The auditorium of the Masonic
Temple serves well as a theatre, and our
admiration for the club is enhanced by the
disclosure that the members design the scenery
and also include in their membership capable
directors. After the play one may dance for an
hour or two, though the cessation of the music
does not mean that you are expected to go to
bed. Very likely some one will furnish forth a
supper and there will be people “asked in” to
contribute to your entertainment.</p>

<p>There are in this community men and women
who rank with the best talkers I have ever
heard. Their neighbors are proud of them and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
produce them on occasion to represent the culture,
the wit and humor, of the town. Two
women of this place are most discerning students
of character. They tell stories with a masterly
touch, and with the economy of words, the
whimsical comment, the pauses and the unforeseen
climaxes that distinguished the storytelling
of Twain and Riley. The inhabitants
make jokes about their Main Street. They
poke fun at themselves as being hicks and
rubes, living far from the great centres of
thought, while discussing the newest books and
finding, I fancy, a mischievous pleasure in
casually telling you something which you, as a
resident of the near-by capital with its three
hundred and twenty thousand people, ought
to have known before.</p>

<p>The value of a local literature, where
it is honest, is that it preserves a record
of change. It is a safe prediction that some
later chronicler of Gopher Prairie will present
a very different community from that revealed
in <i>Main Street</i>. Casting about for an instance
of a State whose history is illustrated
by its literature, I pray to be forgiven if I fall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
back upon Indiana. Edward Eggleston was an
early, if not indeed the first, American realist.
It is now the habit of many Indianians to
flout the <i>Hoosier Schoolmaster</i> as a libel upon
a State that struts and boasts of its culture
and refuses to believe that it ever numbered
ignorant or vulgar people among its inhabitants.
Eggleston’s case is, however, well-supported
by testimony that would pass muster
under the rules of evidence in any fair court
of criticism. Riley, coming later, found kindlier
conditions, and sketched countless types of
the farm and the country town, and made
painstaking studies of the common speech.
His observations began with a new epoch—the
return of the soldiers from the Civil War. The
veracity of his work is not to be questioned;
his contribution to the social history of his
own Hoosier people is of the highest value.
Just as Eggleston and Riley left records of
their respective generations, so Mr. Tarkington,
arriving opportunely to preserve unbroken
the apostolic succession, depicts his own day
with the effect of contributing a third panel
in a series of historical paintings. Thanks to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
our provincial literature, we may view many
other sections through the eyes of novelists;
as, the Maine of Miss Jewett, the Tennessee
of Miss Murfree, the Kentucky of James Lane
Allen, the Virginia of Mr. Page, Miss Johnston,
and Miss Glasgow, the Louisiana of Mr. Cable.
(I am sorry for the new generation that doesn’t
know the charm of <i>Old Creole Days</i> and <i>Madame
Delphine</i>!) No doubt scores of motorists
traversing Minnesota will hereafter see in every
small town a Gopher Prairie, and peer at the
doctors’ signs in the hope of catching the name
of Kennicott!</p>

<p>An idealism persistently struggling to implant
itself in the young soil always has been
manifest in the West, and the record of it is
very marked in the Mississippi Valley States.
Emerson had a fine appreciation of this. He
left Concord frequently to brave the winter
storms in what was then pretty rough country,
to deliver his message and to observe the
people. His philosophy seems to have been
equal to his hardships. “My chief adventure,”
he wrote in his journal of one such pilgrimage,
“was the necessity of riding in a buggy forty-eight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
miles to Grand Rapids; then after lecture
twenty more in return, and the next morning
back to Kalamazoo in time for the train hither
at twelve.” Nor did small audiences disturb
him. “Here is America in the making, America
in the raw. But it does not want much to go
to lectures, and ’tis a pity to drive it.”</p>

<p>There is, really, something about corn—tall
corn, that whispers on summer nights in what
George Ade calls the black dirt country.
There is something finely spiritual about corn
that grows like a forest in Kansas and Nebraska.
And Democracy is like unto it—the plowing,
and the sowing, and the tending to keep
the weeds out. We can’t scratch a single acre
and say all the soil’s bad;—it may be wonderfully
rich in the next township!</p>

<p>It is the way of nature to be perverse and
to fashion the good and great out of the least
promising clay. Country men and small-town
men have preponderated in our national counsels
and all things considered they haven’t done
so badly. Greatness has a way of unfolding itself;
it remains true that the fault is in ourselves,
and not in our stars, that we are underlings.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
Out of one small town in Missouri came the
two men who, just now, hold respectively the
rank of general and admiral of our army and
navy. And there is a trustworthy strength in
elemental natures—in what Whitman called
“powerful uneducated persons.” Ancestry and
environment are not negligible factors, yet if
Lincoln had been born in New York and Roosevelt
in a Kentucky log cabin, both would have
reached the White House. In the common
phrase, you can’t keep a good man down. The
distinguishing achievement of Drinkwater’s
<i>Lincoln</i> is not merely his superb realization of
a great character, but the sense so happily
communicated, of a wisdom deep-planted in
the general heart of man. It isn’t all just luck,
the workings of our democracy. If there’s any
manifestation on earth of a divine ordering of
things, it is here in America. Considering that
most of the hundred million trudge along away
back in the line where the music of the band
reaches them only faintly, the army keeps
step pretty well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span></p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>“Myself when young did eagerly frequent”
lecture-halls and the abodes of the high-minded
and the high-intentioned who were zealous in
the cause of culture. This was in those years
when Matthew Arnold’s criticisms of America
and democracy in general were still much discussed.
Thirty years ago it really seemed that
culture was not only desirable but readily attainable
for America. We cherished happy
illusions as to the vast possibilities of education:
there should be no Main Street without its
reverence for the best thought and noblest
action of all time. But those of us who are able
to ponder “the heavy and the weary weight
of all this unintelligible world” in the spirit
of that period must reflect, a little ruefully,
that the new schemes and devices of education
to which we pointed with pride have not
turned the trick. The machinery of enlightenment
has, of course, greatly multiplied. The
flag waves on innumerable schoolhouses; literature,
art, music are nowhere friendless. The
women of America make war ceaselessly upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
philistinism, and no one attentive to their
labors can question their sincerity or their
intelligence. But these are all matters as to
which many hear the call but comparatively
few prostrate themselves at the mercy-seat.
Culture, in the sense in which we used the
word, was not so easily to be conferred or imposed
upon great bodies of humanity; the percentage
of the mass who are seriously interested
in the finest and noblest action of mankind
has not perceptibly increased.</p>

<p>Odd as these statements look, now that I
have set them down, I hasten to add that they
stir in me no deep and poignant sorrow. My
feeling about the business is akin to that of a
traveller who has missed a train but consoles
himself with the reflection that by changing
his route a trifle he will in due course reach
his destination without serious delay, and at
the same time enjoy a view of unfamiliar
scenery.</p>

<p>Between what Main Street wants and cries
for and what Main Street really needs there
is a considerable margin for speculation. I
shall say at once that I am far less concerned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
than I used to be as to the diffusion of
culture in the Main Streets of all creation.
Culture is a term much soiled by ignoble use
and all but relegated to the vocabulary of cant.
We cannot “wish” Plato upon resisting and
hostile Main Streets; we are even finding that
Isaiah and St. Paul are not so potent to conjure
with as formerly. The church is not so
generally the social centre of small communities
as it was a little while ago. Far too many of us
are less fearful of future torment than of a
boost in the price of gasolene. The motor may
be making pantheists of us: I don’t know.
Hedonism in some form may be the next phase;
here, again, I have no opinion.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Mr. St. John Ervine complains that we of
the provinces lack individuality; that we have
been so smoothed out and conform so strictly
to the prevailing styles of apparel that the
people in one town look exactly like those in
the next. This observation may be due in some
measure to the alien’s preconceived ideas of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
what the hapless wights who live west of the
Hudson ought to look like, but there is much
truth in the remark of this amiable friend from
overseas. Even the Indians I have lately seen
look quite comfortable in white man’s garb.
To a great extent the ready-to-wear industry
has standardized our raiment, so that to the
unsophisticated masculine eye at least the
women of Main Street are indistinguishable
from their sisters in the large cities. There is
less slouch among the men than there used to be.
Mr. Howells said many years ago that in travelling
Westward the polish gradually dimmed on
the shoes of the native; but the shine-parlors
of the sons of Romulus and Achilles have
changed all that.</p>

<p>I lean to the idea that it is not well for us
all to be tuned to one key. I like to think that
the farm folk and country-town people of Georgia
and Kansas, Oklahoma and Maine are
thinking independently of each other about
weighty matters, and that the solidarity of
the nation is only the more strikingly demonstrated
when, finding themselves stirred (sometimes
tardily) by the national consciousness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
they act sensibly and with unity and concord.
But the interurban trolley and the low-priced
motor have dealt a blow to the old smug complacency
and indifference. There is less tobacco-juice
on the chins of our rural fellow citizens;
the native flavor, the raciness and the tang so
highly prized by students of local color have
in many sections ceased to be. We may yet
be confronted by the necessity of preserving
specimens of the provincial native in social
and ethnological museums.</p>

<p>I should like to believe that the present with
its bewildering changes is only a corridor leading,
politically and spiritually, toward something
more splendid than we have known. We
can only hope that this is true, and meanwhile
adjust ourselves to the idea that a good many
things once prized are gone forever. I am not
sure but that a town is better advertised by
enlightened sanitary ordinances duly enforced
than by the number of its citizens who are
acquainted with the writings of Walter Pater.
A little while ago I should have looked upon
such a thought as blasphemy.</p>

<p>The other evening, in a small college town,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
I passed under the windows of a hall where
a fraternity dance was in progress. I dare say
the young gentlemen of the society knew no
more of the Greek alphabet than the three
letters inscribed over the door of their clubhouse.
But this does not trouble me as in “the
olden golden glory of the days gone by.” We
do not know but that in some far day a prowling
New Zealander, turning up a banjo and a
trap-drum amid the ruins of some American
college, will account them nobler instruments
than the lyre and lute.</p>

<p>Evolution brought us down chattering from
the trees, and we have no right to assume that
we are reverting to the arboreal state. This
is no time to lose confidence in democracy;
it is too soon to chant the recessional of the
race. Much too insistently we have sought to
reform, to improve, to plant the seeds of culture,
to create moral perfection by act of
Congress. If Main Street knows what America
is all about, and bathes itself and is kind and
considerate of its neighbors, why not leave the
rest on the knees of the gods?</p>

<p>What really matters as to Main Street is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
that it shall be happy. We can’t, merely by
taking thought, lift its people to higher levels
of aspiration. Main Street is neither blind nor
deaf; it knows well enough what is going on
in the world; it is not to be jostled or pushed
by condescending outsiders eager to bestow
sweetness and light upon it. It is not unaware
of the desirability of such things; and in its
own fashion and at the proper time it will go
after them. Meanwhile if it is cheerful and
hopeful and continues to vote with reasonable
sanity the rest of the world needn’t despair of
it. After all, it’s only the remnant of Israel
that can be saved. Let Main Street alone!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY</h2>
</div>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">ON a day in July, 1916, thirty-five thousand
people passed under the dome of
the Indiana capitol to look for the last
time upon the face of James Whitcomb Riley.
The best-loved citizen of the Hoosier commonwealth
was dead, and laborers and mechanics
in their working clothes, professional and business
men, women in great numbers, and a host
of children paid their tribute of respect to one
whose sole claim upon their interest lay in his
power to voice their feelings of happiness and
grief in terms within the common understanding.
The very general expressions of sorrow
and affection evoked by the announcement
of the poet’s death encourage the belief that
the lines that formed on the capitol steps might
have been augmented endlessly by additions
drawn from every part of America. I frankly
confess that, having enjoyed his friendship
through many years, I am disqualified from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
passing judgment upon his writings, into much
of which I inevitably read a significance that
may not be apparent to those capable of appraising
them with critical detachment. But
Riley’s personality was quite as interesting as
his work, and I shall attempt to give some
hint of the man as I knew him, with special
reference to his whims and oddities.</p>

<p>My acquaintance with him dates from a
memorable morning when he called on me in
a law office where I copied legal documents,
ran errands, and scribbled verses. At this time
he was a regular contributor to the Sunday
edition of the Indianapolis <i>Journal</i>—a newspaper
of unusual literary quality, most hospitable
to fledgling bards, who were permitted
to shine in the reflected light of Riley’s growing
fame. Some verses of mine having been
copied by a Cincinnati paper, Riley asked about
me at the <i>Journal</i> office and sought me out,
paper in hand, to speak a word of encouragement.
He was the most interesting, as he was
the most amusing and the most lovable man
I have known. No one was quite like Riley,
and the ways in which he suggests other men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
merely call attention to the fact that he was,
after all, wholly different: he was Riley!</p>

<p>He was the best-known figure in our capital;
this was true, indeed, of the entire commonwealth
that he sang into fame. He was below
medium height, neatly and compactly built; fair
and of ruddy complexion. He had been a tow-headed
boy, and while his hair thinned in later
years, any white that crept into it was scarcely
perceptible. A broad flexible mouth and a big
nose were the distinguishing features of a remarkably
mobile face. He was very near-sighted,
and the rubber-rimmed glasses he invariably
wore served to obscure his noticeably large blue
eyes. He was a compound of Pennsylvania
Dutch and Irish, but the Celt in him was dominant:
there were fairies in his blood.</p>

<p>In his days of health he carried himself alertly
and gave an impression of smartness. He was
in all ways neat and orderly; there was no
slouch about him and no Byronic affectations.
He was always curious as to the origin of any
garment or piece of haberdashery displayed
by his intimates, but strangely secretive as to
the source of his own supplies. He affected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
obscure tailors, probably because they were
likelier to pay heed to his idiosyncrasies than
more fashionable ones. He once deplored to me
the lack of attention bestowed upon the waistcoat
by sartorial artists. This was a garment
he held of the highest importance in man’s
adornment. Hopkinson Smith, he averred, was
the only man he had ever seen who displayed
a satisfactory taste and was capable of realizing
the finest effects in this particular.</p>

<p>He inspired affection by reason of his gentleness
and inherent kindliness and sweetness.
The idea that he was a convivial person, delighting
in boon companions and prolonged
sessions at table, has no basis in fact. He was
a domestic, even a cloistral being; he disliked
noise and large companies; he hated familiarity,
and would quote approvingly what Lowell
said somewhere about the annoyance of being
clapped on the back. Riley’s best friends never
laid hands on him; I have seen strangers or
new acquaintances do so to their discomfiture.</p>

<p>No background of poverty or early hardship
can be provided for this “poet of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
people.” His father was a lawyer, an orator
well known in central Indiana, and Riley’s
boyhood was spent in comfortable circumstances.
The curtailment of his schooling was
not enforced by necessity, but was due to his
impatience of restraint and inability to adjust
his own interests to the prevailing curriculum.
He spent some time in his father’s
office at Greenfield, reading general literature,
not law, and experimenting with verse. He
served an apprenticeship as a house painter,
and acquired the art of “marbling” and “graining”—long-abandoned
embellishments of domestic
architecture. Then, with four other
young men, he began touring Indiana, painting
signs, and, from all accounts, adding greatly to
the gaiety of life in the communities visited. To
advertise their presence, Riley would recite
in the market-place, or join with his comrades
in giving musical entertainments. Or, pretending
to be blind, he would laboriously climb
up on a scaffolding and before the amazed
spectators execute a sign in his best style. There
was a time when he seemed anxious to forget
his early experiences as a wandering sign-painter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
and entertainer with a patent-medicine
van, but in his last years he spoke of them
quite frankly.</p>

<p>He had a natural talent for drawing; in fact,
in his younger days he dabbled in most of
the arts. He discoursed to me at length on one
occasion of musical instruments, about all of
which he seemed to have much curious lore.
He had been able to play more or less successfully
upon the violin, the banjo, the guitar, and
(his humor bubbling) the snare and bass drum!
“There’s nothing,” he said, “so much fun as
thumping a bass drum,” an instrument on
which he had performed in the Greenfield band.
“To throw your legs over the tail of a band
wagon and thump away—there’s nothing like
it!” As usual when the reminiscent mood was
upon him, he broadened the field of the discussion
to include strange characters he had
known among rural musicians, and these were
of endless variety. He had known a man who
was passionately fond of the bass drum and
who played solos upon it—“Sacred music”!
Sometimes the neighbors would borrow the
drum, and he pictured the man’s chagrin when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
after a hard day’s work he went home and
found his favorite instrument gone.</p>

<p>Riley acquired various mechanical devices
for creating music and devoted himself to them
with childish delight. In one of his gay moods
he would instruct a visitor in the art of pumping
his player-piano, and, having inserted a
favorite “roll,” would dance about the room
snapping his fingers in time to the music.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Riley’s reading was marked by the casualness
that was part of his nature. He liked small
books that fitted comfortably into the hand,
and he brought to the mere opening of a volume
and the cutting of leaves a deliberation eloquent
of all respect for the contents. Always a
man of surprises, in nothing was he more surprising
than in the wide range of his reading.
It was never safe to assume that he was unacquainted
with some book which might appear
to be foreign to his tastes. His literary judgments
were sound, though his prejudices (always
amusing and frequently unaccountable)
occasionally led him astray.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>While his study of literature had followed
the haphazard course inevitable in one so uninfluenced
by formal schooling, it may fairly
be said that he knew all that it was important
for him to know of books. He was of those
for whom life and letters are of one piece and
inseparable. In a broad sense he was a humanist.
What he missed in literature he acquired
from life. Shakespeare he had absorbed
early; Herrick, Keats, Tennyson, and Longfellow
were deep-planted in his memory. His
excursions into history had been the slightest;
biographies and essays interested him much
more, and he was constantly on the lookout
for new poets. No new volume of verse, no
striking poem in a periodical escaped his watchful
eye.</p>

<p>He professed to believe that Mrs. Browning
was a poet greatly superior to her husband.
Nevertheless he had read Robert Browning
with some attention, for on one or two occasions
he burlesqued successfully that poet’s
mannerisms. For some reason he manifested
a marked antipathy to Poe. And in this connection
it may be of interest to mention that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
he was born (October 7, 1849) the day Poe
died! But for Riley’s cordial dislike of Poe I
might be tempted to speculate upon this coincidence
as suggesting a relinquishment of the
singing robes by one poet in favor of another.
Riley had, undoubtedly, at some time felt
Poe’s spell, for there are unmistakable traces
of Poe’s influence in some of his earlier work.
Indeed, his first wide advertisement came
through an imitation of Poe—a poem called
“Leonanie”—palmed off as having been found
written in an old schoolbook that had been
Poe’s property. Riley long resented any reference
to this hoax, though it was a harmless
enough prank—the device of a newspaper
friend to prove that public neglect of Riley
was not based upon any lack of merit in his
writings. It was probably Poe’s sombreness
that Riley did not like, or possibly his personal
characteristics. Still, he would close any
discussion of Poe’s merits as a writer by declaring
that “The Raven” was clearly inspired
by Mrs. Browning’s “Lady Geraldine’s Courtship.”
This is hardly susceptible of proof, and
Elizabeth Barrett’s gracious acceptance of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
compliment of Poe’s dedication of his volume
containing “The Raven” may or may not
be conclusive as to her own judgment in the
matter.</p>

<p>Whitman had no attraction for Riley; he
thought him something of a charlatan. He
greatly admired Stevenson and kept near at
hand a rare photograph of the Scot which
Mrs. Stevenson had given him. He had recognized
Kipling’s genius early, and his meeting
with that writer in New York many years
ago was one of the pleasantest and most satisfactory
of all his literary encounters.</p>

<p>The contentions between Realism and Romanticism
that occasionally enliven our periodical
literature never roused his interest; his
sympathies were with the conservatives and he
preferred gardens that contained familiar and
firmly planted literary landmarks. He knew
his Dickens thoroughly, and his lifelong attention
to “character” was due no doubt in
some measure to his study of Dickens’s portraits
of the quaint and humorous. He always
confessed gratefully his indebtedness to Longfellow,
and once, when we were speaking of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
the older poet, he remarked that Mark Twain
and Bret Harte were other writers to whom
he owed much. Harte’s obligations to both
Dickens and Longfellow are, of course, obvious
and Harte’s use of dialect in verse probably
strengthened Riley’s confidence in the Hoosier
speech as a medium when he began to find
himself.</p>

<p>His humor—both as expressed in his writings,
and as we knew it who lived neighbor to
him—was of the same <i>genre</i> as Mark Twain’s.
And it is not surprising that Mark Twain and
Riley should have met on grounds of common
sympathy and understanding. What the Mississippi
was to the Missourian, the Old National
Road that bisected Greenfield was to Riley.
The larger adventure of life that made Clemens
a cosmopolitan did not appeal to Riley, with
his intense loyalty to the State of his birth
and the city that for thirty-eight years was
his home.</p>

<p>It gave him the greatest pleasure to send his
friends books that he thought would interest
them. Among those he sent me are Professor
Woodberry’s selections from Aubrey de Vere,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
whose “Bard Ethell” Riley thought a fine performance;
Bradford Torrey’s <i>Friends on the
Shelf</i> and, a few weeks before his death, a copy
of G. K. Chesterton’s poems in which he had
written a substitute for one of the lines. If in
these gifts he chose some volume already known
to the recipient, it was well to conceal the fact,
for it was essential to the perfect course of his
friendships that he be taken on his own terms,
and no one would have had the heart to spoil
his pleasure in a “discovery.”</p>

<p>He was most generous toward all aspirants
in his own field, though for years these were
prone to take advantage of his good nature by
inflicting books and manuscripts upon him.
I once committed the indiscretion of uttering
a volume of verse, and observed with trepidation
a considerable number of copies on the
counter of the bookstore where we did much
loafing together. A few days later I was surprised
and for a moment highly edified to find
the stock greatly depleted. On cautious inquiry
I found that it was Riley alone who had been
the investor—to the extent of seventy-five
copies, which he distributed widely among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
literary acquaintances. In the case of another
friend who published a book without large expectations
of public favor, Riley secretly purchased
a hundred and scattered them broadcast.
These instances are typical: he would do
a kind thing furtively and evince the deepest
embarrassment when detected.</p>

<p>It is always a matter for speculation as to
just what effect a college training would have
upon men of Riley’s type, who, missing the
inscribed portals, nevertheless find their way
into the house of literature. I give my opinion
for what it may be worth, that he would have
been injured rather than benefited by an ampler
education. He was chiefly concerned with human
nature, and it was his fortune to know
profoundly those definite phases and contrasts
of life that were susceptible of interpretation
in the art of which he was sufficiently the
master. Of the general trend of society and
social movements he was as unconscious as
though he lived on another planet. I am
disposed to think that he profited by his ignorance
of such things, which left him to the
peaceful contemplation of the simple phenomena<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
of life that had early attracted him.
Nothing seriously disturbed his inveterate provincial
habit of thought. He manifested Thoreau’s
indifference—without the Yankee’s scorn—for
the world beyond his dooryard. “I can
see,” he once wrote me, “when you talk of
your return and the prospective housewarming
of the new home, that your family’s
united heart is right here in old Indianapolis—high
Heaven’s sole and only understudy.”
And this represented his very sincere feeling
about “our” town; no other was comparable
to it!</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>He did his writing at night, a fact which
accounted for the spacious leisure in which
his days were enveloped. He usually had a
poem pretty thoroughly fixed in his mind before
he sought paper, but the actual writing
was often a laborious process; and it was his
habit, while a poem was in preparation, to
carry the manuscript in his pocket for convenience
of reference. The elisions required by
dialect and his own notions of punctuation—here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
he was a law unto himself—brought him
into frequent collision with the lords of the
proof desk; but no one, I think, ever successfully
debated with him any point of folk speech.
I once ventured to suggest that his use of the
phrase “durin’ the army,” as a rustic veteran’s
way of referring to the Civil War, was not
general, but probably peculiar to the individual
he had heard use it. He stoutly defended his
phrase and was ready at once with witnesses
in support of it as a familiar usage of Indiana
veterans.</p>

<p>In the matter of our Hoosier folk speech
he was an authority, though the subject did
not interest him comparatively or scientifically.
He complained to me bitterly of an editor who
had directed his attention to apparent inconsistencies
of dialect in the proof of a poem.
Riley held, and rightly, that the dialect of the
Hoosier is not fixed and unalterable, but varies
in certain cases, and that words are often pronounced
differently in the same sentence. Eggleston’s
Hoosier is an earlier type than Riley’s,
belonging to the dark years when our illiteracy
staggered into high percentages. And Eggleston<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
wrote of southern Indiana, where the “poor
white” strain of the South had been most
marked. Riley not only spoke for a later period,
but his acquaintance was with communities
that enjoyed a better social background; the
schoolhouse and the rural “literary” were always
prominent in his perspective.</p>

<p>He had preserved his youth as a place apart
and unalterable, peopled with folk who lived
as he had known them in his enchanted boyhood.
Scenes and characters of that period he
was able to revisualize at will. When his homing
fancy took wing, it was to bear him back to
the little town’s dooryards, set with mignonette,
old-fashioned roses, and borders of hollyhocks,
or countryward to the streams that wound
their way through fields of wheat and corn.
Riley kept his place at innumerable firesides
in this dream existence, hearing the veterans
of the Civil War spin their yarns, or farmers
discuss crop prospects, or the whispers of children
awed by the “woo” of the wind in the
chimney. If Pan crossed his vision (he drew
little upon mythology) it was to sit under a
sycamore above a “ripple” in the creek and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
beat time rapturously with his goat hoof to
the music of a Hoosier lad’s willow whistle.</p>

<p>The country lore that Riley had collected
and stored in youth was inexhaustible; it never
seemed necessary for him to replenish his
pitcher at the fountains of original inspiration.
I have read somewhere a sketch of him in which
he was depicted as walking with Wordsworthian
calm through lonely fields, but nothing could
be more absurd. Fondly as he sang of green
fields and running brooks, he cultivated their
acquaintance very little after he established
his home at Indianapolis. Lamb could not have
loved city streets more than he. Much as Bret
Harte wrote of California after years of absence,
so Riley drew throughout his life from
scenes familiar to his boyhood and young manhood,
and with undiminished sympathy and
vigor.</p>

<p>His knowledge of rural life was intimate,
though he knew the farm only as a country-town
boy may know it, through association
with farm boys and holidays spent in visits to
country cousins. Once at the harvest season,
as we were crossing Indiana in a train, he began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
discoursing on apples. He repeated Bryant’s
poem “The Planting of the Apple Tree,” as
a prelude, and, looking out over the Hoosier
Hesperides, began mentioning the varieties of
apples he had known and commenting on their
qualities. When I expressed surprise at the
number, he said that with a little time he
thought he could recall a hundred kinds, and
he did in fact name more than fifty before we
were interrupted.</p>

<p>The whimsicalities and comicalities and the
heart-breaking tragedies of childhood he interpreted
with rare fidelity. His wide popularity
as a poet of childhood was due to a special
genius for understanding the child mind. Yet
he was very shy in the presence of children,
and though he kept track of the youngsters in
the houses of his friends, and could establish
himself on good terms with them, he seemed
uncomfortable when suddenly confronted by
a strange child. This was due in some measure
to the proneness of parents to exhibit their
offspring that he might hear them “recite”
his own poems, or in the hope of eliciting some
verses commemorative of Johnny’s or Mary’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
precocity. His children were country-town and
farm children whom he had known and lived
among and unconsciously studied and appraised
for the use he later made of them. Here, again,
he drew upon impressions fixed in his own boyhood,
and to this gallery of types he never, I
think, added materially. Much of his verse for
children is autobiographical, representing his
own attitude of mind as an imaginative, capricious
child. Some of his best character studies
are to be found among his juvenile pieces. In
“That-Air Young-Un,” for example, he enters
into the heart of an abnormal boy who</p>

</div></div>

<p>The only poem he ever contributed to the
<i>Atlantic</i> was “Old Glory,” and I recall that
he held it for a considerable period, retouching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
it, and finally reading it at a club dinner to
test it thoroughly by his own standards, which
were those of the ear as well as the eye. When
I asked him why he had not printed it he said
he was keeping it “to boil the dialect out of
it.” On the other hand, “The Poet of the Future,”
one of his best pieces, was produced in
an evening. He was little given to displaying
his poems in advance of publication, and this
was one of the few that he ever showed me in
manuscript. It had been a real inspiration;
the writing of it had given him the keenest
pleasure, and the glow of success was still upon
him when we met the following morning. He
wrote much occasional and personal verse
which added nothing to his reputation—a fact
of which he was perfectly aware—and there
is a wide disparity between his best and his
poorest. He wrote prose with difficulty; he
said he could write a column of verse much
more quickly than he could produce a like
amount of prose.</p>

<p>His manuscripts and letters were works of
art, so careful was he of his handwriting—a
small, clear script as legible as engraving, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
with quaint effects of capitalization. In his
younger days he indulged in a large correspondence,
chiefly with other writers. His letters
were marked by the good-will and cordiality,
the racy humor and the self-mockery of his
familiar talk. “Your reference”—this is a typical
beginning—“to your vernal surroundings
and cloistered seclusion from the world stress

in veriest truth</p>

<p>as that grand poet Oliver W. Longfellow so
tersely puts it in his inimitable way.” He addressed
his correspondents by names specially
designed for them, and would sign himself by
any one of a dozen droll pseudonyms.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Riley’s talent as a reader (he disliked the
term recitationist) was hardly second to his
creative genius. As an actor—in such parts,
for example, as those made familiar by Jefferson—he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
could not have failed to win high rank.
His art, apparently the simplest, was the result
of the most careful study and experiment;
facial play, gesture, shadings of the voice, all
contributed to the completeness of his portrayals.
So vivid were his impersonations and
so readily did he communicate the sense of
atmosphere, that one seemed to be witnessing
a series of dramas with a well-set stage and a
diversity of players. He possessed in a large
degree the magnetism that is the birthright
of great actors; there was something very
appealing and winning in his slight figure as
he came upon the platform. His diffidence
(partly assumed and partly sincere) at the
welcoming applause, the first sound of his voice
as he tested it with the few introductory sentences
he never omitted—these spoken haltingly
as he removed and disposed of his glasses—all
tended to pique curiosity and win the
house to the tranquillity his delicate art demanded.
He said that it was possible to offend
an audience by too great an appearance of
cock-sureness; a speaker did well to manifest
a certain timidity when he walked upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
stage, and he deprecated the manner of a certain
lecturer and reader, who always began by
chaffing his hearers. Riley’s programmes consisted
of poems of sentiment and pathos, such
as “Good-bye, Jim” and “Out to Old Aunt
Mary’s,” varied with humorous stories in prose
or verse which he told with inimitable skill
and without a trace of buffoonery. Mark Twain
wrote, in “How to Tell a Story,” that the
wounded-soldier anecdote which Riley told
for years was, as Riley gave it, the funniest
thing he ever listened to.</p>

<p>In his travels Riley usually appeared with
another reader. Richard Malcolm Johnston,
Eugene Field, and Robert J. Burdette were at
various times associated with him, but he is
probably more generally known for his joint
appearances with the late Edgar W. (“Bill”)
Nye. He had for Nye the warmest affection,
and in the last ten years of his life would recount
with the greatest zest incidents of their
adventures on the road—Nye’s practical jokes,
his droll comments upon the people they met,
the discomforts of transportation, and the horrors
of hotel cookery. Riley’s admiration for his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
old comrade was so great that I sometimes suspected
that he attributed to Nye the authorship
of some of his own stories in sheer excess
of devotion to Nye’s memory.</p>

<p>His first reception into the inner literary
circle was in 1887, when he participated in
the authors’ readings given in New York to
further the propaganda of the Copyright
League. Lowell presided on these occasions,
and others who contributed to the exercises
were Mark Twain, George W. Cable, Richard
Henry Stoddard, Thomas Nelson Page, Henry
C. Bunner, George William Curtis, Charles
Dudley Warner, and Frank R. Stockton. It
was, I believe, Mr. Robert Underwood Johnson,
then of the <i>Century Magazine</i> (which had
just enlisted Riley as a contributor), who was
responsible for this recognition of the Hoosier.
Nothing did more to establish Riley as a serious
contestant for literary honors than his success
on this occasion. He was greeted so cordially—from
contemporaneous accounts he “ran away
with the show”—that on Lowell’s urgent invitation
he appeared at a second reading.</p>

<p>Riley’s intimate friendships with other writers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
were comparatively few, due largely to
his home-keeping habit, but there were some
for whom, without ever seeing much of them,
he had a liking that approached affection.
Mark Twain was one of these; Mr. Howells
and Joel Chandler Harris were others. He saw
Longfellow on the occasion of his first visit
to Boston. Riley had sent him several of his
poems, which Longfellow had acknowledged
in an encouraging letter; but it was not the
way of Riley to knock at any strange door,
and General “Dan” Macaulay, once mayor
of Indianapolis, a confident believer in the young
Hoosier’s future, took charge of the pilgrimage.
Longfellow had been ill, but he appeared unexpectedly
just as a servant was turning the visitors
away. He was wholly kind and gracious,
and “shook hands five times,” Riley said, when
they parted. The slightest details of that call—it
was shortly before Longfellow’s death—were
ineffaceably written in Riley’s memory—even
the lavender trousers which, he insisted,
Longfellow wore!</p>

<p>Save for the years of lyceum work and the
last three winters of his life spent happily in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
Florida, Riley’s absences from home were
remarkably infrequent. He derived no pleasure
from the hurried travelling made necessary
by his long tours as a reader; he was
without the knack of amusing himself in strange
places, and the social exactions of such journeys
he found very irksome. Even in his active years,
before paralysis crippled him, his range of activities
was most circumscribed. The Lockerbie
Street in which he lived so comfortably, tucked
away though it is from the noisier currents of
traffic, lies, nevertheless, within sound of the
court-house bell, and he followed for years a
strict routine which he varied rarely and only
with the greatest apprehension as to the possible
consequences.</p>

<p>It was a mark of our highest consideration
and esteem to produce Riley at entertainments
given in honor of distinguished visitors, but this
was never effected without considerable plotting.
(I have heard that in Atlanta “Uncle
Remus” was even a greater problem to his
fellow citizens!) Riley’s innate modesty, always
to be reckoned with, was likely to smother
his companionableness in the presence of ultra-literary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
personages. His respect for scholarship,
for literary sophistication, made him reluctant
to meet those who, he imagined, breathed a
divine ether to which he was unacclimated. At
a small dinner in honor of Henry James he
maintained a strict silence until one of the other
guests, in an effort to “draw out” the novelist,
spoke of Thomas Hardy and the felicity of his
titles, mentioning <i>Under the Greenwood Tree</i>
and <i>A Pair of Blue Eyes</i>. Riley, for the first
time addressing the table, remarked quietly of
the second of these, “It’s an odd thing about
eyes, that they usually come in sets!”—a comment
which did not, as I remember, strike
Mr. James as being funny.</p>

<p>Riley always seemed a little bewildered by
his success, and it was far from his nature to
trade upon it. He was at pains to escape from
any company where he found himself the centre
of attraction. He resented being “shown off”
(to use his own phrase) like “a white mouse
with pink eyes.” He cited as proof that he
was never intended for a social career the unhappy
frustration of his attempt to escort his
first sweetheart to a party. Dressed with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
greatest care, he knocked at the beloved’s
door. Her father eyed him critically and demanded:
“What you want, Jimmy?”</p>

<p>“Come to take Bessie to the party.”</p>

<p>“Humph! Bessie ain’t goin’ to no party;
Bessie’s got the measles!”</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>In so far as Riley was a critic of life and conduct,
humor was his readiest means of expression.
Whimsical turns of speech colored his
familiar talk, and he could so utter a single
word—always with quiet inadvertence—as to
create a roar of laughter. Apart from the commoner
type of anecdotal humor, he was most
amusing in his pursuit of fancies of the Stocktonesque
order. I imagine that he and John
Holmes of Old Cambridge would have understood
each other perfectly; all the Holmes
stories I ever heard—particularly the one about
Methuselah and the shoe-laces, preserved by
Colonel Higginson—are very similar to yarns
invented by Riley.</p>

<p>To catch his eye in a company or at a public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
gathering was always dangerous, for if he was
bored or some tedious matter was forward,
he would seek relief by appealing to a friend
with a slight lifting of the brows, or a telepathic
reference to some similar situation in
the past. As he walked the streets with a companion
his comments upon people and trifling
incidents of street traffic were often in his best
humorous vein. With his intimates he had a
fashion of taking up without prelude subjects
that had been dropped weeks before. He was
greatly given to assuming characters and assigning
parts to his friends in the little comedies
he was always creating. For years his favorite
rôle was that of a rural preacher of a type
that had doubtless aroused his animosity in
youth. He built up a real impression of this
character—a cadaverous person of Gargantuan
appetite, clad in a long black alpaca coat, who
arrived at farmhouses at meal-times and depleted
the larder, while the children of the
household, awaiting the second table in trepidation,
gloomily viewed the havoc through
the windows. One or another of us would be
Brother Hotchkiss, or Brother Brookwarble,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
and we were expected to respond in his own
key of bromidic pietism. This device, continually
elaborated, was not wholly foolishness
on his part, but an expression of his deep-seated
contempt for cant and hypocrisy, which he regarded
as the most grievous of sins.</p>

<p>When he described some “character” he
had known, it was with an amount of minute
detail that made the person stand forth as a
veritable being. Questions from the listener
would be welcomed, as evidence of sympathy
with the recital and interest in the individual
under discussion. As I journeyed homeward
with him once from Philadelphia, he began
limning for two companions a young lawyer
he had known years before at Greenfield. He
carried this far into the night, and at the breakfast
table was ready with other anecdotes of
this extraordinary individual. When the train
reached Indianapolis the sketch, vivid and
amusing, seemed susceptible of indefinite expansion.</p>

<p>In nothing was he more diverting than in
the superstitions he affected. No life could
have been freer from annoyances and care<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
than his, and yet he encouraged the belief that
he was pursued by a “hoodoo.” This was the
most harmless of delusions, and his nearest
friends encouraged the idea for the enjoyment
they found in his intense satisfaction whenever
any untoward event—never anything important—actually
befell him. The bizarre, the
fantastic, had a mild fascination for him; he
read occult meanings into unusual incidents
of every kind. When Alfred Tennyson Dickens
visited Indianapolis I went with him to call
on Riley. A few days later Mr. Dickens died
suddenly in New York, and soon afterward I
received a note that he had written me in the
last hour of his life. Riley was so deeply
impressed by this that he was unable to free
his mind of it for several days. It was an
astounding thing, he said, to receive a letter from
a dead man. For a time he found comfort in
the idea that I shared the malevolent manifestations
to which he fancied himself subject.
We were talking in the street one day when a
brick fell from a building and struck the sidewalk
at our feet. He was drawing on a glove
and quite characteristically did not start or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
manifest any anxiety as to his safety. He lifted
his head guardedly and with a casual air said:
“I see they’re still after you” (referring to
the fact that a few weeks earlier a sign had
fallen on me in Denver). Then, holding out
his hands, he added mournfully: “They’re
after me, too!” The gloves—a pair brought
him from London by a friend—were both lefts.</p>

<p>A number of years ago he gave me his own
copy of the <i>Oxford Book of English Verse</i>—an
anthology of which he was very fond. In it
was pasted a book-plate that had previously
escaped me. It depicted an old scholar in knee-breeches
and three-cornered hat, with an armful
of books. When asked about the plate, Riley
explained that a friend had given it to him,
but that he had never used it because, on counting
the books, there seemed to be thirteen of
them. However, some one having convinced
him that the number was really twelve, the
evil omen was happily dispelled.</p>

<p>Politics interested him not at all, except as
to the personal characteristics of men prominent
in that field. He voted only once, so he
often told me, and that was at the behest of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
a friend who was a candidate for some local
office. Finding later that in his ignorance of the
proper manner of preparing a ballot he had voted
for his friend’s opponent, he registered a vow, to
which he held strictly, never to vote again. My
own occasional dabblings in politics caused him
real distress, and once, when I had playfully
poked into a hornet’s nest, he sought me out
immediately to warn me of the dire consequences
of such temerity. “They’ll burn your barn,”
he declared; “they’ll kidnap your children!”</p>

<p>His incompetence—real or pretended—in
many directions was one of the most delightful
things about him. Even in the commonest
transactions of life he was rather helpless—the
sort of person one instinctively assists and
protects. His deficiencies of orientation were a
joke among his friends, and though he insisted
that he couldn’t find his way anywhere, I’m
disposed to think that this was part of the
make-believe in which he delighted. When he
intrusted himself to another’s leading he was
always pleased if the guide proved as incapable
as himself. Lockerbie Street is a little hard to
find, even for lifelong Indianapolitans, and for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
caller to confess his difficulties in reaching it
was sure to add to the warmth of his welcome.</p>

<p>Riley had no patience for research, and cheerfully
turned over to friends his inquiries of every
sort. Indeed he committed to others with comical
light-heartedness all matters likely to prove
vexatious or disagreeable. He was chronically
in search of something that might or might
not exist. He complained for years of the loss
of a trunk containing letters from Longfellow,
Mark Twain, and others, though his ideas as
to its genesis and subsequent history were
altogether hazy.</p>

<p>He was a past master of the art of postponement,
but when anything struck him as urgent
he found no peace until he had disposed of it.
He once summoned two friends, at what was
usually for him a forbidden hour of the morning,
to repair forthwith to the photographer’s, that
the three might have their pictures taken, his
excuse being that one or another might die
suddenly, leaving the desired “group” unrealized—a
permanent sorrow to the survivors.</p>

<p>His portrait by Sargent shows him at his
happiest, but for some reason he never appeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
to care for it greatly. There was, I believe,
some vague feeling on his part that one
of the hands was imperfect—a little too
sketchy, perhaps. He would speak cordially
of Sargent and describe his method of work
with characteristic attention to detail; but
when his opinion of the portrait was solicited,
he would answer evasively or change the subject.</p>

<p>He clung tenaciously to a few haunts, one of
these being for many years the office of the
<i>Journal</i>, to which he contributed the poems in
dialect that won his first recognition. The back
room of the business office was a favorite loafing
place for a number of prominent citizens who
were responsive to Riley’s humor. They maintained
there something akin to a country-store
forum of which Riley was the bright particular
star. A notable figure of those days in our capital
was Myron Reed, a Presbyterian minister
of singular gifts, who had been a captain of
cavalry in the Civil War. Reed and William
P. Fishback, a lawyer of distinction, also of
the company, were among the first Americans
to “discover” Matthew Arnold. Riley’s only
excursion abroad was in company with Reed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
and Fishback, and surely no more remarkable
trio ever crossed the Atlantic. It is eloquent
of the breadth of Riley’s sympathies that he
appreciated and enjoyed the society of men
whose interests and activities were so wholly
different from his own. They made the usual
pious pilgrimages, but the one incident that
pleased Riley most was a supper in the Beefsteak
Room adjoining Irving’s theatre, at which
Coquelin also was a guest. The theatre always
had a fascination for Riley, and this occasion
and the reception accorded his reading of some
of his poems marked one of the high levels of
his career. Mr. Fishback reported that Coquelin
remarked to Irving of Riley’s recitations, that
the American had by nature what they had
been twenty years acquiring.</p>

<p>In keeping with the diffidence already referred
to was his dread of making awkward
or unfortunate remarks, and it was like him
to exaggerate greatly his sins of this character.
He illustrated Irving’s fine nobility by an incident
offered also as an instance of his own
habit of blundering. Riley had known for years
an English comedian attached to a stock company<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
at Indianapolis, and he mentioned this
actor to Irving and described a bit of “business”
he employed in the part of First Clown
in the graveyard scene in “Hamlet.” Irving not
only professed to remember the man, but confirmed
in generous terms Riley’s estimate of
his performance as the grave-digger. When
Riley learned later that what he had believed
to be the unique practice of his friend had been
the unbroken usage of the stage from the time
of Shakespeare, he was inconsolable, and his
blunder was a sore point with him to the end
of his days.</p>

<p>Though his mail was enormous, he was always
solicitous that no letter should escape.
For a time it pleased him to receive mail at
three points of delivery—his house, his publisher’s,
and the office of a trust company where
a desk was reserved for him. The advantage of
this was that it helped to fill in the day and
to minimize the disparity between his own
preoccupations and the more exacting employments
of his friends. Once read, the letters
were likely to be forgotten, but this did not
lessen his joy in receiving them. He was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
meek slave of autograph-hunters, and at the
holiday season he might be found daily inscribing
books that poured in remorselessly from
every part of the country.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>The cheery optimism, tolerance, and mercy
that are the burden of his verse summed up
his religion. He told me once that he was a
Methodist; at least, he had become a member
of that body in his youth, and he was not aware,
as he put it, that they had ever “fired” him.
For a time he was deeply interested in Spiritualism
and attended séances; but I imagine that
he derived no consolation from these sources,
as he never mentioned the subject in later
years. Though he never probed far into such
matters, speculations as to immortality always
appealed to him, and he often reiterated his
confidence that we shall meet and recognize,
somewhere in the beyond, those who are dear
to us on earth. His sympathy for bereaved
friends was marked by the tenderest feeling.
“It’s all right,” he would say bravely, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
did believe, sincerely, in a benign Providence
that makes things “right.”</p>

<p>Here was a life singularly blessed in all its
circumstances and in the abundant realization
of its hopes and aims. Few poets of any
period have received so generous an expression
of public regard and affection as fell to Riley’s
lot. The very simplicity of his message and the
melodious forms in which it was delivered won
him the wide hearing that he enjoyed and that
seems likely to be his continuing reward far
into the future. Yale wrote him upon her rolls
as a Master of Arts, the University of Pennsylvania
made him a Doctor of Letters. The American
Academy of Arts and Letters bestowed
upon him its gold medal in the department of
poetry; his last birthdays were observed in
many parts of the country. Honor, love, obedience,
troops of friends were his happy portion,
and he left the world richer for the faith
and hope and honest mirth that he brought
to it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE CHEERFUL BREAKFAST TABLE</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">“A good, honest, wholesome, hungry breakfast.”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="marginleft">—<i>The Compleat Angler.</i></span></p>

<p class="drop-cap">“ONE fine morning in the full London
season, Major Arthur Pendennis came
over from his lodgings, according to
his custom, to breakfast at a certain club in
Pall Mall, of which he was a chief ornament.”
This has always seemed to me the noblest possible
opening for a tale. The zest of a fine morning
in London, the deliberation of a gentleman
taking his ease in his club and fortifying himself
against the day’s events with a satisfying
breakfast, are communicated to the reader in
a manner that at once inspires confidence and
arouses the liveliest expectations. I shall not
go the length of saying that all novels should
begin with breakfast, but where the disclosures
are to be of moment, and we are to be urged
upon adventures calculated to tax our emotions
or our staying powers, a breakfast table
serves admirably as a point of departure. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
thus begin the imaginary day where the natural
day begins, and we form the acquaintance of
the characters at an hour when human nature
is most satisfactorily and profitably studied.</p>

<p>It is only a superstition that night alone
affords the proper atmosphere for romance,
and that the curtain must fall upon the first
scene with the dead face of the king’s messenger
upturned to the moon and the landlord
bawling from an upper window to know what
it’s all about. Morning is the beginning of all
things. Its hours breathe life and hope. “Pistols
and coffee!” The phrase whets the appetite
both for the encounter and the cheering cup.
The duel, to be sure, is no longer in favor, and
it is not for me to lament its passing; but I
mention it as an affair of dewy mornings, indelibly
associated with hours when the hand
is steady and courage runs high.</p>

<p>It may be said with all assurance that breakfast
has fallen into sad neglect, due to the haste
and rush of modern life—the commuter’s
anxiety touching the 8.27, the city man’s fear
that he may not be able to absorb the day’s
news before his car is at the door. Breakfast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
has become a negligible item of the day’s
schedule. An increasing number of American
citizens are unfit to be seen at the breakfast
hour; and a man, woman, or child who cannot
present a cheery countenance at breakfast is
living an unhealthy life upon the brink of disaster.
A hasty visit to the table, the gulping
of coffee, the vicious snapping of teeth upon
food scarcely looked at, and a wild rush to
keep the first appointment noted on the calendar,
is the poorest possible preparation for a
day of honest work. The man who follows
this practice is a terror to his business associates.
Reports that “the boss isn’t feeling well
this morning” pass about the office, with a
disturbance of the morale that does not make
for the efficiency of the establishment. The
wife who reaches the table dishevelled and
fretful, under compulsion of her conscience,
with the idea that the lord of the house should
not be permitted to fare forth without her
benediction, would do better to keep her bed.
If the eggs are overdone or the coffee is cold
and flavorless, her panicky entrance at the
last moment will not save the situation. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
growl from behind the screening newspaper is a
poor return for her wifely self-denial, but she
deserves it. There is guilt upon her soul; if
she had not insisted on taking the Smiths to
supper after the theatre the night before, he
would have got the amount of sleep essential
to his well-being and the curtaining paper
would not be camouflaging a face to which
the good-by kiss at the front door is an affront,
not a caress.</p>

<p>“Have the children come down yet?” the
lone breakfaster growlingly demands. The maid
replies indifferently that the children have
severally and separately partaken of their
porridge and departed. Her manner of imparting
this information signifies rebellion against
a system which makes necessary the repeated
offering of breakfast to persons who accept
only that they may complain of it. No happier
is the matutinal meal in humbler establishments
where the wife prepares and serves the
food, and buttons up Susie’s clothes or sews a
button on Johnny’s jacket while the kettle
boils. If the husband met a bootlegger in the
alley the previous night it is the wife’s disagreeable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
duty to rouse him from his protracted
slumbers; and if, when she has produced
him at the table, he is displeased with
the menu, his resentment, unchecked by those
restraints presupposed of a higher culture, is
manifested in the playful distribution of the
tableware in the general direction of wife and
offspring. The family cluster fearfully at the
door as the head of the house, with surly
resignation, departs for the scene of his daily
servitude with the smoke of his pipe trailing
behind him, animated by no love for the human
race but only by a firm resolution not to lift
his hand until the last echoes of the whistle
have died away.</p>

<p>It is foreign to my purpose to indict a whole
profession, much less the medical fraternity,
which is so sadly harassed by a generation of
Americans who demand in pills and serums
what its progenitors found in the plough handle
and the axe, and yet I cannot refrain from laying
at the doors of the doctors some burden of
responsibility for the destruction of the breakfast
table. The astute and diplomatic physician,
perfectly aware that he is dealing with an outraged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
stomach and that the internal discomfort
is due to overindulgence, is nevertheless
anxious to impose the slightest tax upon the
patient’s self-denial. Breakfast, he reflects, is
no great shakes anyhow, and he suggests that
it be curtailed, or prescribes creamless coffee
or offers some other hint equally banal. This is
wholly satisfactory to Jones, who says with a
sigh of relief that he never cared much for
breakfast, and that he can very easily do without
it.</p>

<p>About twenty-five years ago some one started
a boom for the breakfastless day as conducive to
longevity. I know persons who have clung stubbornly
to this absurdity. The despicable habit
contributes to domestic unsociability and is, I am
convinced by my own experiments, detrimental
to health. The chief business of the world is
transacted in the morning hours, and I am
reluctant to believe that it is most successfully
done on empty stomachs. Fasting as a spiritual
discipline is, of course, quite another thing;
but fasting by a tired business man under
medical compulsion can hardly be lifted to
the plane of things spiritual. To delete breakfast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
from the day’s programme is sheer cowardice,
a confession of invalidism which is well
calculated to reduce the powers of resistance.
The man who begins the day with a proscription
that sets him apart from his neighbors
may venture into the open jauntily, persuading
himself that his abstinence proves his superior
qualities; but in his heart, to say nothing
of his stomach, he knows that he has been
guilty of a sneaking evasion. If he were a normal,
healthy being, he would not be skulking
out of the house breakfastless. Early rising, a
prompt response to the breakfast-bell, a joyous
breaking of the night’s fast is a rite not to be
despised in civilized homes.</p>

<p>Old age rises early and calls for breakfast
and the day’s news. Grandfather is entitled
to his breakfast at any hour he demands it.
He is at an age when every hour stolen from
the night is fairly plucked from oblivion, and
to offer him breakfast in bed as more convenient
to the household, or with a well-meant intention
of easing the day for him, is merely to
wound his feelings. There is something finely
appealing in the thought of a veteran campaigner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
in the army of life who doesn’t wait
for the bugle to sound reveille, but kindles
his fire and eats his ration before his young
comrades are awake.</p>

<p>The failure of breakfast, its growing ill repute
and disfavor are not, however, wholly
attributable to the imperfections of our social
or economic system. There is no more reason
why the homes of the humble should be illumined
by a happy breakfast table than that the
morning scene in abodes of comfort and luxury
should express cheer and a confident faith in
human destiny. Snobbishness must not enter
into this matter of breakfast reform; rich and
poor alike must be persuaded that the morning
meal is deserving of all respect, that it is
the first act of the day’s drama, not to be performed
in a slipshod fashion to spoil the rest
of the play. It is the first chapter of a story,
and every one who has dallied with the art of
fiction knows that not merely the first chapter
but the first line must stir the reader’s imagination.</p>

<p>Morning has been much sung by the poets,
some of them no doubt wooing the lyre in bed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
A bard to my taste, Benjamin S. Parker, an
Indiana pioneer and poet who had lived in a
log cabin and was, I am persuaded, an early
and light-hearted breakfaster, wrote many verses
on which the dew sparkles:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“I had a dream of other days,—</div>
<div class="indent">In golden luxury waved the wheat;</div>
<div class="verse">In tangled greenness shook the maize;</div>
<div class="indent">The squirrels ran with nimble feet,</div>
<div class="verse">And in and out among the trees</div>
<div class="indent">The hangbird darted like a flame;</div>
<div class="verse">The catbird piped his melodies,</div>
<div class="indent">Purloining every warbler’s fame:</div>
<div class="verse">And then I heard triumphal song,</div>
<div class="indent">’Tis morning and the days are long.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>I hope not to imperil my case for the cheerful
breakfast table by asserting too much in
support of it, but I shall not hesitate to say
that the contemptuous disregard in which
breakfast is now held by thousands of Americans
is indisputably a cause of the low state
to which the family tie has fallen. It is a common
complaint of retrospective elderly persons
that the family life, as our grandparents
knew it, has been destroyed by the haste and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
worry incident to modern conditions. Breakfast—a
leisurely, jolly affair as I would have
it, with every member of the household present
on the stroke of the gong—is unequalled
as a unifying force. The plea that everybody
is in a hurry in the morning is no excuse; if
there is any hour when haste is unprofitable
it is that first morning hour.</p>

<p>It is impossible to estimate at this writing
the effect of the daylight-saving movement upon
breakfast and civilization. To add an hour
to the work-day is resented by sluggards who,
hearing seven chime, reflect that it is really only
six, and that a little self-indulgence is wholly
pardonable. However, it is to be hoped that the
change, where accepted in good spirit, may
bring many to a realization of the cheer and
inspiration to be derived from early rising.</p>

<p>A day should not be “jumped into,” but
approached tranquilly and with respect and
enlivened by every element of joy that can
be communicated to it. At noon we are in the
midst of conflict; at nightfall we have won or
lost battles; but in the morning “all is possible
and all unknown.” If we have slept like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
honest folk, and are not afraid of a dash of
cold water, we meet the day blithely and with
high expectation. If the day dawn brightly,
there is good reason for sharing its promise
with those who live under the same roof; if
it be dark and rain beats upon the pane, even
greater is the need of family communion, that
every member may be strengthened for valiant
wrestling with the day’s tasks.</p>

<p>The disorder of the week-day breakfast in
most households is intensified on Sunday morning,
when we are all prone to a very liberal
interpretation of the meaning of a day of rest.
There was a time not so long ago when a very
large proportion of the American people rose on
Sunday morning with no other thought but to go
to church. Children went to Sunday-school, not
infrequently convoyed by their parents. I hold
no brief for the stern inhibitions of the monstrous
Puritan Sunday which hung over childhood
like a gray, smothering cloud. Every one
has flung a brick at Protestantism for its failures
of reconstruction and readjustment to
modern needs, and I am not without my own
shame in this particular. The restoration of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
breakfast to its rightful place would do much
to put a household in a frame of mind for the
contemplation of the infinite. Here, at least,
we are unembarrassed by the urgency of the
tasks of every day; here, for once in the week,
at an hour that may very properly be set forward,
a well-managed family may meet at
table and infuse into the gathering the spirit
of cheerful yesterdays and confident to-morrows.</p>

<p>No better opportunity is afforded for a
friendly exchange of confidences, for the utterance
of words of encouragement and hope
and cheer. Tommy, if he has been dealt with
firmly in this particular on earlier occasions,
will not revive the old and bothersome question
of whether he shall or shall not go to Sunday-school.
If he is a stranger to that institution
by reason of parental incompetence or
apostasy, the hour is not a suitable one for
mama to make timid suggestions as to the
importance of biblical instruction. Nor will
eighteen-year-old Madeline renew her demand
for a new party dress when this matter was
disposed of definitely Saturday night. Nor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
will the father, unless he be of the stuff
of which brutes are made, open a debate with
his wife as to whether he shall accompany her
to church or go to the club for a luxurious hour
with the barber. A well-ordered household will
not begin the week by wrangling on a morning
that should, of all mornings, be consecrated to
serenity and peace.</p>

<p>Great numbers of American households are
dominated by that marvel of the age, the Sunday
newspaper. For this prodigious expression
of journalistic enterprise I have only the warmest
admiration, but I should certainly exclude
it from the breakfast table as provocative of
discord and subversive of discipline. Amusing
as the “funny page” may be, its color scheme
does not blend well either with soft-boiled eggs
or marmalade. Madeline’s appetite for news
of the social world may wait a little, and as
there is no possibility of buying or selling on
the Sabbath-day, the gentleman at the head
of the table may as well curb his curiosity about
the conclusions of the weekly market review.
Fragments of Sunday newspapers scattered
about a breakfast table are not decorative.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
They encourage bad manners and selfishness.
A newspaper is an impudent intrusion at the
table at any time, but on Sunday its presence
is a crime. On an occasion, the late William
Graham Sumner was a guest in my house.
Like the alert, clear-thinking philosopher he
was, he rose early and read the morning paper
before breakfast. He read it standing, and
finding him erect by a window with the journal
spread wide for greater ease in scanning it
quickly, I begged him to be seated. “No,” he
answered; “always read a newspaper standing;
you won’t waste time on it that way.”</p>

<p>With equal firmness I should exclude the
morning mail from the table. The arrival of
the post is in itself an infringement upon domestic
privacy, and the reading of letters is
deadly to that conversation which alone can
make the table tolerable at any meal. Good
news can wait; bad news is better delayed
until the mind and body are primed to deal
with it. If the son has been “canned” at school,
or if the daughter has overstepped her allowance,
or if some absent member of the family
is ill, nothing can be done about it at the breakfast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
table. On the first day of the month, the
dumping of bills on the table, to the accompaniment
of expostulations, regrets, and perhaps
tears, should be forbidden. Few homes
are so controlled by affection and generous
impulses as to make possible the distribution
of bills at a breakfast table without poisoning
the day. A tradesman with the slightest
feeling of delicacy will never mail a bill to
be delivered on the morning of the first
day of the month. Anywhere from the third
or fourth to the twentieth, and so timed as
to be delivered in the afternoon—such would
be my suggestion to the worthy merchant.
The head of the house knows, at dinner time,
the worst that the day has for him; if fortune
has smiled, he is likely to be merciful; if fate
has thrown the dice against him, he will be
humble. And besides, a discreet wife, receiving
an account that has hung over her head ever
since she made that sad, rash purchase, has,
if the bill arrive in the afternoon post, a chance
to conceal the odious thing until such time as
the domestic atmosphere is clear and bright.
Attempts to sneak the dressmaker’s bill under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
the coffee-pot are fraught with peril; such concealments
are unworthy of American womanhood.
Let the hour or half-hour at the breakfast
table be kept free of the taint of bargain
and sale, a quiet vestibule of the day, barred
against importunate creditors.</p>

<p>As against the tendency, so destructive of
good health and mental and moral efficiency,
to slight breakfast, the food manufacturers
have set themselves with praiseworthy determination
to preserve and dignify the meal.
One has but to peruse the advertising pages
of the periodicals to learn of the many tempting
preparations that are offered to grace the
breakfast table. The obtuse, inured to hasty
snatches, nibbles, and sips, are assisted to a
proper appreciation of these preparations by
the most enchanting illustrations. The art of
publicity has spent itself lavishly to lure the
world to an orderly and contemplative breakfast
with an infinite variety of cereals that
have been subjected to processes which make
them a boon to mankind. When I hear of an
addition to the long list, I fly at once to the
grocer to obtain one of the crisp packages, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
hurry home to deposit it with the cook for early
experiment. The adventurous sense is roused
not only by the seductive advertisement but
by the neatness of the container, the ears of
corn or the wheat sheaf so vividly depicted on
the wrapper, or the contagious smile of a
radiant child brandishing a spoon and demanding
more.</p>

<p>Only a slouchy and unimaginative housewife
will repeat monotonously a breakfast
schedule. A wise rotation, a continual surprise
in the food offered, does much to brighten
the table. The damnable iteration of ham and
eggs has cracked the pillars of many a happy
home. There should be no ground for cavil;
the various items should not only be well-chosen,
but each dish should be fashioned as for
a feast of high ceremony. Gluttony is a grievous
sin; breakfast, I repeat, should be a spiritual
repast. If fruit is all that the soul craves, well
enough; but let it be of paradisiacal perfection.
If coffee and a roll satisfy the stomach’s craving,
let the one be clear and not so bitter as
to keep the imbiber’s heart protesting all day,
and the other hot enough to melt butter and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
of ethereal lightness. The egg is the most sinned
against of all foods. It would seem that no one
could or would wantonly ruin an egg, a thing
so useful, so inoffensive; and yet the proper
cooking of an egg is one of the most difficult of
all culinary arts. Millions of eggs are ruined
every year in American kitchens. Better that
the whole annual output should be cast into
the sea than that one egg should offend the
eye and the palate of the expectant breakfaster.</p>

<p>It grieves me to be obliged to confess that
in hotels and on dining-cars, particularly west
of Pittsburgh, many of my fellow citizens are
weak before the temptation of hot cakes,
drenched in syrup. I have visited homes where
the griddle is an implement frequently invoked
through the winter months, and I have at times,
in my own house, met the buckwheat cake
and the syrup jug and meekly fallen before
their combined assault; but the sight of a man
eating hot cakes on a flying train, after a night
in a sleeper, fills me with a sense of desolation.
Verily it is not alone the drama that the tired
business man has brought to low estate!</p>

<p>Sausage and buckwheat cakes have never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
appealed to me as an inevitable combination
like ham and eggs. Beefsteak and onions at
the breakfast hour are only for those who expect
to devote the remainder of the day to
crime or wood-chopping. The scent in itself
is not the incense for rosy-fingered morn; and
steak at breakfast, particularly in these times
of perpendicular prices, speaks for vulgar
display rather than generosity.</p>

<p>The history of breakfast, the many forms
that it has known, the customs of various tribes
and nations, assist little in any attempt to re-establish
the meal in public confidence. Plato
may have done his loftiest thinking on an
empty stomach; I incline to the belief that
Sophocles was at all times a light breakfaster;
Horace must regret that he passed into the
Elysian Fields without knowing the refreshing
qualities of a grapefruit. If my post-mortem
terminal were less problematical, I should like
to carry him a grapefruit—a specimen not
chilled to death in cold storage—and divide
it with him, perhaps adding a splash of
Falernian for memory’s sake. But the habits
of the good and great of olden times are not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
of the slightest importance to us of twentieth-century
America. Still, not to ignore wholly
the familiar literary associations suggested by
my subject, Samuel Rogers and his weakness
for entertaining at breakfast shall have honorable
mention. Rogers’s breakfasts, one of his
contemporaries hinted, were a cunning test
of the fitness of the guests to be promoted to
the host’s dinner table—a process I should
have reversed, on the theory that the qualifications
for breakfast guests are far more exacting
than those for a dinner company. We
have testimony that Rogers’s breakfasts, informal
and with every one at ease, were much
more successful than his dinners. Wordsworth,
Coleridge, Byron and Moore, Southey and
Macaulay, the Duke of Wellington and Lord
John Russell were fellows to make a lively
breakfast table. At one of these functions Coleridge
talked for three hours on poetry, an occasion
on which, we may assume, the variety
or quality of the food didn’t matter greatly.</p>

<p>Breakfast as a social medium has never
flourished in America, chiefly because of our
lack of leisure. Where recognized at all it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
thrown into the middle of the day where it
becomes an anomaly, an impudent intrusion.
A breakfast that is a luncheon is not a breakfast,
but a concession to the Philistines. Once,
with considerable difficulty, I persuaded a
lady of my acquaintance to undertake to popularize
breakfast by asking a company, few
and fit, for eight o’clock. The first party was
delightful, and the second, moved along to
nine, was equally successful. But the hostess
was so pleased with her success that she increased
the number of guests to a dozen and
then to fifteen, and advanced the hour to noon,
with the result that the felicity of the earlier
hours was lost. One must have a concrete programme
to be of service in these reforms, and
I shall say quite fearlessly that a round table
set for six is the ideal arrangement.</p>

<p>A breakfast must be planned with greatest
care. It should never be resorted to as a means
of paying social debts, but arranged with the
utmost independence. Where a wife is a desirable
guest and the husband is not, there is
no reason why a plate should be wasted. On
the other hand, I should as rigidly exclude the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
wife who is socially a non-conductor. The talk
at a breakfast table must be spirited, and it
will not be otherwise if the company is well
chosen. It’s an absurd idea that candle-light
is essential to sociability and that wit will not
sparkle in the early morning. Some of the best
talk I ever listened to has been at breakfast
tables, where the guests conversed freely under
the inspiration of a mounting sun. Doctor
Holmes clearly believed the breakfast hour
appropriate for the disclosure of the sprightliest
philosophy.</p>

<p>An American novelist once explained that
he did his writing in the afternoon because he
couldn’t make love in the morning. Not make
love in the morning! The thought is barbarous.
Morning is of sentiment all compact. Morning
to the lover who possesses a soul is washed
with Olympian dews. The world is all before
him where to choose and his heart is his only
guide. Love is not love that fears the morning
light.... There was a house by the sea,
whence a girl used to dart forth every morning
for a run over the rocks. We used to watch
her from our windows, admiring the lightness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
of her step, her unconscious grace as she
was silhouetted on some high point of the shore
against the blue of sea and sky. It was to think
of him, her lover, in the free sanctuary of the
new, clean day that she ran that morning race
with her own spirits. And he, perhaps knowing
that she was thus preparing herself for their
first meeting, would fly after her, and they
would come running back, hand in hand, and
appear with glowing cheeks and shining eyes
at the breakfast table, to communicate to the
rest of us the joy of youth.</p>

<p>There are houses in which participation in
the family breakfast is frankly denied to the
guest, who is informed that by pressing a
button in his room coffee will appear at any
hour that pleases his fancy. Let us consider
this a little. The ideal guest is rare; the number
of persons one really enjoys having about,
free to penetrate the domestic arcana, is small
indeed. This I say who am not an inhospitable
soul. That a master and mistress should keep
the morning free is, however, no sign of unfriendliness;
the shoving of breakfast into a
room does not argue necessarily for churlishness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
and I have never so interpreted it. A
hostess has her own affairs to look after, and
the despatch of trays up-stairs enables her to
guard her morning from invasion. Still, in a
country house, a guest is entitled to a fair shot
at the morning. The day is happier when the
household assembles at a fixed hour not to be
trifled with by a lazy and inconsiderate guest.</p>

<p>Moreover, we are entitled to know what our
fellows look like in the morning hours. I have
spoken of lovers, and there is no sterner test
of the affections than a breakfast-table inspection.
Is a yawn unbecoming? We have a right
to know with what manner of yawn we are to
spend our lives. Is it painful to listen to the
crunching of toast in the mouth of the adored?
Is the wit laggard in the morning hours when
it should be at its nimblest? These are grave
matters not lightly to be brushed aside. At
breakfast the blemish in the damask cheek
publishes itself shamelessly; an evil temper
that is subdued by candle-light will betray
itself over the morning coffee. At breakfast
we are what we are, and not what we may make
ourselves for good or ill before the stars twinkle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>I protest against breakfast in bed as not
only unsocial but unbecoming in the children
of democracy. I have never succumbed to this
temptation without experiencing a feeling of
humiliation and cowardice. A proper punishment
for such self-indulgence is inflicted by
the stray crumbs that lodge between the sheets
unless one be highly skilled in the handling
of breakfast trays. Crumbs in bed! Procrustes
missed a chance here. The presence of emptied
dishes in a bedroom is disheartening in itself;
the sight of them brings to a sensitive soul a
conviction of incompetence and defeat. You
cannot evade their significance; they are the
wreck of a battle lost before you have buckled
on your armor or fired an arrow at the foe.
My experiments have been chiefly in hotels,
where I have shrunk from appearing in a vast
hall built for banqueting and wholly unsuitable
for breakfasting; but better suffer this
gloomy isolating experience than huddle between
covers and balance a tray on stubborn
knees that rebel at the indignity.</p>

<p>The club breakfast is an infamous device
designed to relieve the mind of what should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
the pleasant privilege of selection. I am uninformed
as to who invented this iniquity of
numbered alternatives, but I unhesitatingly
pronounce him an enemy of mankind. Already
too many forces are operating to beat
down the imagination. I charge this monstrosity
upon the propagandists of realism;
certainly no romanticist in the full possession
of his powers would tolerate a thing so deadly
to the play of fancy. I want neither the No. 7
nor the No. 9 prescribed on the card; and the
waiter’s index finger wabbling down the margin
in an attempt to assist me is an affront, an
impudence. Breakfast should be an affair between
man and his own soul; a business for
the initiative, not the referendum.</p>

<p>Breakfast out of doors is the ideal arrangement,
or in winter under an ample screen of
glass. My own taste is for a perspective of sea
or lake; but a lusty young river at the elbow
is not to be despised. The camper, of course,
has always the best of it; a breakfast of fresh-caught
trout with an Indian for company serves
to quicken such vestiges of the primitive as remain
in us. But we do not, if we are wise, wait<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
for ideal conditions. It is a part of the great
game of life to make the best of what we have,
particularly in a day that finds the world
spinning madly “down the ringing grooves
of change.”</p>

<p>The breakfast table must be made a safe
place for humanity, an inspirational centre of
democracy. A land whose people drowsily turn
over for another nap at eight o’clock, or languidly
ring for coffee at eleven, is doomed to
destruction. Of such laziness is unpreparedness
born—the vanguard of the enemy already
howling at the postern; treason rampant in
the citadel; wailing in the court. Breakfast, a
sensible meal at a seasonable hour; sausage or
beefsteak if you are capable of such atrocities;
or only a juicy orange if your appetite be
dainty; but breakfast, a cheerful breakfast
with family or friends, no matter how great
the day’s pressure. This, partaken of in a mood
of kindliness and tolerance toward all the world,
is a definite accomplishment. By so much we
are victors, and whether the gulfs wash us down
or we sight the happy isles we have set sail with
flags flying and to the stirring roll of drums.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE BOULEVARD OF ROGUES</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">NOTHING was ever funnier than Barton’s
election to the city council.
However, it occurs to me that if I’m
going to speak of it at all, I may as well tell
the whole story.</p>

<p>At the University Club, where a dozen of
us have met for luncheon every business day
for many years, Barton’s ideas on the subject
of municipal reform were always received in
the most contumelious fashion. We shared his
rage that things were as they were, but as practical
business men we knew that there was no
remedy. A city, Barton held, should be conducted
like any other corporation. Its affairs
are so various, and touch so intimately the
comfort and security of all of us, that it is imperative
that they be administered by servants
of indubitable character and special training.
He would point out that a citizen’s rights and
privileges are similar to those of a stockholder,
and that taxes are in effect assessments to
which we submit only in the belief that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
sums demanded are necessary to the wise handling
of the public business; that we should be
as anxious for dividends in the form of efficient
and economical service as we are for cash dividends
in other corporations.</p>

<p>There is nothing foolish or unreasonable in
these notions; but most of us are not as ingenious
as Barton, or as resourceful as he in
finding means of realizing them.</p>

<p>Barton is a lawyer and something of a cynic.
I have never known a man whose command
of irony equalled his. He usually employed it,
however, with perfect good nature, and it was
impossible to ruffle him. In the court-room I
have seen him the target for attacks by a formidable
array of opposing counsel, and have
heard him answer an hour’s argument in an
incisive reply compressed into ten minutes.
His suggestions touching municipal reforms
were dismissed as impractical, which was absurd,
for Barton is essentially a practical man,
as his professional successes clearly proved
before he was thirty. He maintained that one
capable man, working alone, could revolutionize
a city’s government if he set about it in the right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
spirit; and he manifested the greatest scorn for
“movements,” committees of one hundred, and
that sort of thing. He had no great confidence in
the mass of mankind or in the soundness of
the majority. His ideas were, we thought, often
fantastic, but it could never be said that he
lacked the courage of his convictions. He once
assembled round a mahogany table the presidents
of the six principal banks and trust companies
in our town and laid before them a plan
by which, through the smothering of the city’s
credit, a particularly vicious administration
might be brought to terms. The city finances
were in a bad way, and, as the result of a policy
of wastefulness and short-sightedness, the administration
was constantly seeking temporary
loans, which the local banks were expected to
carry. Barton dissected the municipal budget
before the financiers, and proposed that, as
another temporary accommodation was about
to be asked, they put the screws on the mayor
and demand that he immediately force the
resignations of all his important appointees
and replace them with men to be designated
by three citizens to be named by the bankers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
Barton had carefully formulated the whole
matter, and he presented it with his usual clarity
and effectiveness; but rivalry between the
banks for the city’s business, and fear of incurring
the displeasure of some of their individual
depositors who were closely allied
with the bosses of the bipartisan machine,
caused the scheme to be rejected. Our lunch-table
strategy board was highly amused by
Barton’s failure, which was just what we had
predicted.</p>

<p>Barton accepted his defeat with equanimity
and spoke kindly of the bankers as good men
but deficient in courage. But in the primaries
the following spring he got himself nominated
for city councilman. No one knew just how
he had accomplished this. Of course, as things
go in our American cities, no one qualified for
membership in a university club is eligible
for any municipal office, and no man of our
acquaintance had ever before offered himself
for a position so utterly without honor or
dignity. Even more amazing than Barton’s
nomination was Barton’s election. Our councilmen
are elected at large, and we had assumed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
that any strength he might develop in the
more prosperous residential districts would be
overbalanced by losses in industrial neighborhoods.</p>

<p>The results proved to be quite otherwise.
Barton ran his own campaign. He made no
speeches, but spent the better part of two
months personally appealing to mechanics and
laborers, usually in their homes or on their
door-steps. He was at pains to keep out of the
newspapers, and his own party organization
(he is a Republican) gave him only the most
grudging support.</p>

<p>We joked him a good deal about his election
to an office that promised nothing to a man
of his type but annoyance and humiliation.
His associates in the council were machine
men, who had no knowledge whatever of enlightened
methods of conducting cities. The
very terminology in which municipal government
is discussed by the informed was as
strange to them as Sanskrit. His Republican
colleagues cheerfully ignored him, and shut
him out of their caucuses; the Democrats resented
his appearance in the council chamber<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
as an unwarranted intrusion—“almost an indelicacy,”
to use Barton’s own phrase.</p>

<p>The biggest joke of all was Barton’s appointment
to the chairmanship of the Committee
on Municipal Art. That this was the only recognition
his associates accorded to the keenest
lawyer in the State—a man possessing a broad
knowledge of municipal methods, gathered in
every part of the world—was ludicrous, it must
be confessed; but Barton was not in the least
disturbed, and continued to suffer our chaff
with his usual good humor.</p>

<p>Barton is a secretive person, but we learned
later that he had meekly asked the president
of the council to give him this appointment.
And it was conferred upon him chiefly because
no one else wanted it, there being, obviously,
“nothing in” municipal art discernible to the
bleared eye of the average councilman.</p>

<p>About that time old Sam Follonsby died,
bequeathing half a million dollars—twice as
much as anybody knew he had—to be spent
on fountains and statues in the city parks and
along the boulevards.</p>

<p>The many attempts of the administration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
to divert the money to other uses; the efforts
of the mayor to throw the estate into the hands
of a trust company in which he had friends—these
matters need not be recited here.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say that Barton was equal to
all the demands made upon his legal genius.
When the estate was settled at the end of a
year, Barton had won every point. Follonsby’s
money was definitely set aside by the court
as a special fund for the objects specified by
the testator, and Barton, as the chairman of
the Committee on Municipal Art, had so tied
it up in a legal mesh of his own ingenious contriving
that it was, to all intents and purposes,
subject only to his personal check.</p>

<p>It was now that Barton, long irritated by
the indifference of our people to the imperative
need of municipal reform, devised a plan
for arousing the apathetic electorate. A philosopher,
as well as a connoisseur in the fine
arts, he had concluded that our whole idea of
erecting statues to the good and noble serves
no purpose in stirring patriotic impulses in the
bosoms of beholders. There were plenty of
statues and not a few tablets in our town commemorating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
great-souled men, but they suffered
sadly from public neglect. And it must
be confessed that the average statue, no matter
how splendid the achievements of its subject,
is little regarded and serves only passively as
a reminder of public duty. With what has
seemed to me a sublime cynicism, Barton proceeded
to spend Follonsby’s money in a manner
at once novel and arresting. He commissioned
one of the most distinguished sculptors in the
country to design a statue; and at the end of
his second year in the council (he had been
elected for four years), it was set up on the
new boulevard that parallels the river.</p>

<p>His choice of a subject had never been made
known, so that curiosity was greatly excited
on the day of the unveiling. Barton had brought
the governor of an adjoining State, who was
just then much in the public eye as a fighter
of grafters, to deliver the oration. It was a
speech with a sting to it, but our people had
long been hardened to such lashings. The mayor
spoke in praise of the civic spirit which had
impelled Follonsby to make so large a bequest
to the public; and then, before five thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
persons, a little schoolgirl pulled the cord, and
the statue, a splendid creation in bronze, was
exposed to the amazed populace.</p>

<p>I shall not undertake to depict the horror
and chagrin of the assembled citizens when
they beheld, instead of the statue of Follonsby,
which they were prepared to see, or a symbolic
representation of the city itself as a flower-crowned
maiden, the familiar pudgy figure,
reproduced with the most cruel fidelity, of
Mike O’Grady, known as “Silent Mike,” a
big bipartisan boss who had for years dominated
municipal affairs, and who had but lately
gone to his reward. The inscription in itself
was an ironic master-stroke:</p>

<p class="center">To<br>
Michael P. O’Grady<br>
Protector of Saloons, Friend of Crooks<br>
For Ten Years a City Councilman<br>
Dominating the Affairs of the Municipality<br>
This Statue is Erected<br>
By Grateful Fellow-Citizens<br>
In Recognition of his Public Services</p>

<p>The effect of this was tremendously disturbing,
as may be imagined. Every newspaper in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
America printed a picture of the O’Grady
statue; our rival cities made merry over it at
our expense. The Chamber of Commerce, incensed
at the affront to the city’s good name,
passed resolutions condemning Barton in the
bitterest terms; the local press howled; a mass-meeting
was held in our biggest hall to voice
public indignation. But amid the clamor Barton
remained calm, pointing to the stipulation
in Follonsby’s will that his money should be
spent in memorials of men who had enjoyed
most fully the confidence of the people. And as
O’Grady had been permitted for years to run
the town about as he liked, with only feeble
protests and occasional futile efforts to get rid
of him, Barton was able to defend himself
against all comers.</p>

<p>Six months later Barton set up on the same
boulevard a handsome tablet commemorating
the services of a mayor whose venality had
brought the city to the verge of bankruptcy,
and who, when his term of office expired, had
betaken himself to parts unknown. This was
greeted with another outburst of rage, much
to Barton’s delight. After a brief interval another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
tablet was placed on one of the river
bridges. The building of that particular bridge
had been attended with much scandal, and
the names of the councilmanic committee who
were responsible for it were set forth over these
figures:</p>

<table>
<tr><td>Cost to the People</td><td class="tdr">     $249,950.00</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cost to the Council &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;</td><td class="tdr">     131,272.81</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr" colspan="2">—————</td></tr>
<tr><td> &#160; &#160; Graft</td><td class="tdr"> $118,677.19</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The figures were exact and a matter of record.
An impudent prosecuting attorney who had
broken with the machine had laid them before
the public some time earlier; but his efforts
to convict the culprits had been frustrated by
a judge of the criminal court who took orders
from the bosses. Barton broke his rule against
talking through the newspapers by issuing a
caustic statement imploring the infuriated
councilmen to sue him for libel as they threatened
to do.</p>

<p>The city was beginning to feel the edge of
Barton’s little ironies. At the club we all realized
that he was animated by a definite and
high purpose in thus flaunting in enduring
bronze the shame of the city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>“It is to such men as these,” said Barton,
referring to the gentlemen he had favored with
his statue and tablets, “that we confide all
our affairs. For years we have stupidly allowed
a band of outlaws to run our town. They spend
our money; they manage in their own way
large affairs that concern all of us; they sneer
at all the forces of decency; they have made
serfs of us. These scoundrels are our creatures,
and we encourage and foster them; they represent
us and our ideals, and it’s only fitting that
we should publish their merits to the world.”</p>

<p>While Barton was fighting half a dozen injunction
suits brought to thwart the further
expenditure of Follonsby’s money for memorials
of men of notorious misfeasance or malfeasance,
another city election rolled round. By this
time there had been a revulsion of feeling. The
people began to see that after all there might
be a way of escape. Even the newspapers that
had most bitterly assailed Barton declared
that he was just the man for the mayoralty,
and he was fairly driven into office at the head
of a non-partisan municipal ticket.</p>

<p>The Boulevard of Rogues we called it for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
a time. But after Barton had been in the
mayor’s office a year he dumped the O’Grady
statue into the river, destroyed the tablets,
and returned to the Follonsby Fund out of
his own pocket the money he had paid for them.
Three noble statues of honest patriots now
adorn the boulevard, and half a dozen beautiful
fountains have been distributed among
the parks.</p>

<p>The Barton plan is, I submit, worthy of all
emulation. If every boss-ridden, machine-managed
American city could once visualize its
shame and folly as Barton compelled us to
do, there would be less complaint about the
general failure of local government. There is,
when you come to think of it, nothing so preposterous
in the idea of perpetuating in outward
and visible forms the public servants we
humbly permit to misgovern us. Nothing could
be better calculated to quicken the civic impulse
in the lethargic citizen than the enforced
contemplation of a line of statues erected to
rascals who have prospered at the expense of
the community.</p>

<p>I’m a little sorry, though, that Barton never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
carried out one of his plans, which looked to
the planting in the centre of a down-town park
of a symbolic figure of the city, felicitously
expressed by a barroom loafer dozing on a
whiskey barrel. I should have liked it, and
Barton confessed to me the other day that he
was a good deal grieved himself that he had not
pulled it off!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE OPEN SEASON FOR AMERICAN<br>
NOVELISTS</h2>

<p class="ph1">[1915]</p>
</div>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">THIS is the open season for American
novelists. The wardens are in hiding
and any one with a blunderbuss and a
horn of powder is entitled to all the game he
can kill. The trouble was started by Mr. Edward
Garnett, a poacher from abroad, who
crawled under the fence and wrought great
havoc before he was detected. His invasion
roused the envy of scores of native hunters,
and at their behest all laws for game protection
have been suspended, to satisfy the general
craving for slaughter. Mr. Owen Wister on his
bronco leads the field, a daring and orgulous
knight, sincerely jealous for the good name of
the ranges. The fact that I was once beguiled
by an alluring title into purchasing one of his
books in the fond hope that it would prove to
be a gay romance about a lady, only to find
that the heroine was, in fact, a cake, does not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
alter my amiable feelings toward him. I made
a pious pilgrimage to the habitat of that cake
and invested in numerous replicas for distribution
all the way from Colorado to Maine, accompanied
by copies of the novel that so
adroitly advertised it—a generosity which I
have refrained from mentioning to Mr. Wister
or his publisher to this day.</p>

<p>Mr. Wister’s personal experiences have
touched our oldest and newest civilization,
and it is not for me to quarrel with him. Nor
should I be saddling Rosinante for a trot over
the fearsome range had he not taken a pot
shot at poor old Democracy, that venerable
offender against the world’s peace and dignity.
To drive Mr. Bryan and Mr. Harold Bell
Wright into a lonely cleft of the foot-hills and
rope and tie them together seems to me an
act of inhumanity unworthy of a good sportsman.
As I am unfamiliar with Mr. Wright’s
writings, I can only express my admiration
for Mr. Wister’s temerity in approaching them
close enough to apply the branding-iron. Mr.
Bryan as the protagonist of Democracy may
not be dismissed so easily. To be sure, he has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
never profited by any ballot of mine, but he
has at times laid the lash with a sure hand on
shoulders that needed chastisement. However,
it is the free and unlimited printing of novels
that here concerns us, not the consecration of
silver.</p>

<p>Democracy is not so bad as its novels, nor,
for that matter, is a constitutional monarchy.
The taste of many an American has been debased
by English fiction. At the risk of appearing
ungracious, I fling in Mr. Garnett’s teeth
an armful of the writings of Mr. Hall Caine,
Mrs. Barclay, and Marie Corelli. The slightest
regard for the literary standards of a young
and struggling republic should prompt the
mother country to keep her trash at home. It
is our most grievous sin that we have merely
begun to manufacture our own rubbish, in a
commendable spirit of building up home industries.
In my youth I was prone to indulge in
pirated reprints of engrossing tales of adorable
curates’ nieces who were forever playing Cinderella
at hunt balls, and breaking all the hearts
in the county. They were dukes’ daughters,
really, changed in the cradle—Trollope, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
a dash of bitters; but their effect upon me I
believe to have been baneful.</p>

<p>A lawyer of my acquaintance used to remark
in opening a conference with opposing
counsel: “I am merely thinking aloud; I don’t
want to be bound by anything I say.” It is a
good deal in this spirit that I intrude upon
the field of carnage, fortified with a white flag
and a Red Cross badge. The gentle condescension
of foreign critics we shall overlook as
lacking in novelty; moreover, Mr. Lowell disposed
of that attitude once and for all time.</p>

<p>If anything more serious is to be required
in this engagement than these casual shots
from my pop-gun I hastily tender my proxy
to Mr. Howells. And I am saying (in a husky
aside) that if in England, our sadly myopic
stepmother, any one now living has served
letters with anything like the high-minded
devotion of Mr. Howells, or with achievements
comparable to his for variety, sincerity, and
distinction, I shall be glad to pay postage for
his name.</p>

<p>We must not call names or make faces, but
address ourselves cheerfully to the business at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
hand. The American novel is, beyond question,
in a bad way. Something is radically wrong
with it. The short story, too, is under fire. Professor
Canby would clap a Russian blouse on
it and restore its first fine careless rapture.
He makes out a good case and I cheerfully
support his cause, with, however, a reservation
that we try the effect of American overalls
and jumper before committing ourselves fully
to Slavic vestments. In my anxiety to be of
service to the friends of American fiction, I
am willing to act as pall-bearer or officiating
minister, or even as corpse, with proper guaranties
of decent burial.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Our slow advance in artistic achievement
has been defended on the plea that we have
no background, no perspective, and that our
absorption in business affairs leaves no time
for that serene contemplation of life that is
essential to the highest attainments. To omit
the obvious baccalaureate bromide that we are
inheritors of the lore of all the ages, it may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
suggested that our deficiencies in the creative
arts are overbalanced by the prodigious labors
of a people who have lived a great drama in
founding and maintaining a new social and
political order within little more than a century.</p>

<p>Philosophers intent upon determining the
causes of our failure to contribute more importantly
to all the arts have suggested that
our creative genius has been diverted into
commercial and industrial channels; that Bell
and Edison have stolen and imprisoned the
Promethean fire, while the altars of the arts
have been left cold. Instead of sending mankind
whirling over hill and dale at a price within
the reach of all, Mr. Henry Ford might have
been our enlaurelled Thackeray if only he had
been born beneath a dancing star instead of
under the fiery wheels of Ezekiel’s vision.</p>

<p>The preachiness of our novels, of which critics
complain with some bitterness, may be reprehensible,
but it is not inexplicable. We are a
people bred upon the Bible; it was the only
book carried into the wilderness; it still has
a considerable following among us, and all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
reports of our depravity are greatly exaggerated.
We are inured to much preaching.
We tolerate where we do not admire Mr. Bryan,
because he is the last of the circuit-riders, a
tireless assailant of the devil and all his works.</p>

<p>I am aware of growls from the Tory benches
as I timidly venture the suggestion—fully
conscious of its impiety—that existing cosmopolitan
standards may not always with
justice be applied to our literary performances.
The late Colonel Higginson once supported
this position with what strikes me as an excellent
illustration. “When,” he wrote, “a
vivacious Londoner like Mr. Andrew Lang
attempts to deal with that profound imaginative
creation, Arthur Dimmesdale in <i>The Scarlet
Letter</i>, he fails to comprehend him from an
obvious and perhaps natural want of acquaintance
with the whole environment of the man.
To Mr. Lang he is simply a commonplace clerical
Lovelace, a dissenting clergyman caught
in a shabby intrigue. But if this clever writer
had known the Puritan clergy as we know them,
the high priests of a Jewish theocracy, with the
whole work of God in a strange land resting on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
their shoulders, he would have comprehended
the awful tragedy in this tortured soul.”</p>

<p>In the same way the exalted place held by
Emerson in the affections of those of us who
are the fortunate inheritors of the Emerson
tradition can hardly be appreciated by foreign
critics to whom his writings seem curiously
formless and his reasoning absurdly tangential.
He may not have been a great philosopher, but
he was a great philosopher for America. There
were English critics who complained bitterly of
Mark Twain’s lack of “form,” and yet I can
imagine that his books might have lost the
tang and zest we find in them if they had conformed
to Old-World standards.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the English in which
our novels are written must be defended by
abler pens than mine. Just why American prose
is so slouchy, so lacking in distinction, touches
questions that are not for this writing. I shall
not even “think aloud” about them! And yet,
so great is my anxiety to be of service and to
bring as much gaiety to the field as possible,
that I shall venture one remark: that perhaps
the demand on the part of students in our colleges<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
to be taught to write short stories, novels,
and dramas—and the demand is insistent—has
obscured the importance of mastering a
sound prose before any attempt is made to employ
it creatively. It certainly cannot be complained
that the literary impulse is lacking,
when publishers, editors, and theatrical producers
are invited to inspect thousands of
manuscripts every year. The editor of a popular
magazine declares that there are only
fifteen American writers who are capable of
producing a “good” short story; and this,
too, at a time when short fiction is in greater
demand than ever before, and at prices that
would cause Poe and De Maupassant to turn
in their graves. A publisher said recently that
he had examined twenty novels from one writer,
not one of which he considered worth publishing.</p>

<p>Many, indeed, are called but few are chosen,
and some reason must be found for the low
level of our fiction where the output is so great.
The fault is not due to unfavorable atmospheric
conditions, but to timidity on the part
of writers in seizing upon the obvious American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
material. Sidney Lanier remarked of Poe that
he was a great poet, but that he did not know
enough—meaning that life in its broad aspects
had not touched him. A lack of “information,”
of understanding and vision, is, I should say,
the fundamental weakness of the American
novel. To see life steadily and whole is a large
order, and prone as we are to skim light-heartedly
the bright surfaces, we are not easily
to be persuaded to creep to the rough edges
and peer into the depths. We have not always
been anxious to welcome a “physician of the
iron age” capable of reading “each wound,
each weakness clear,” and saying “thou ailest
here and here”! It is not “competent” for
the artist to plead the unattractiveness of his
material at the bar of letters; it is his business
to make the best of what he finds ready
to his hand. It is because we are attempting to
adjust humanity to new ideals of liberty that
we offer to ourselves, if not to the rest of the
world, a pageant of ceaseless interest and variety.</p>

<p>It may be that we are too much at ease in
our Zion for a deeper probing of life than our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
fiction has found it agreeable to make. And
yet we are a far soberer people than we were
when Mr. Matthew Arnold complained of our
lack of intellectual seriousness. The majority
has proved its soundness in a number of instances
since he wrote of us. We are less impatient
of self-scrutiny. Our newly awakened
social consciousness finds expression in many
books of real significance, and it is inevitable
that our fiction shall reflect this new sobriety.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, since the passing of our New
England Olympians, literature as a vocation
has had little real dignity among us; we have
had remarkably few novelists who have settled
themselves to the business of writing with any
high or serious aim. Hawthorne as a brooding
spirit has had no successor among our fictionists.
Our work has been chiefly tentative, and
all too often the experiments have been made
with an eye on the publisher’s barometer. Literary
gossip is heavy with reports of record-breaking
rapidity of composition. A writer
who can dictate is the envy of an adoring circle;
another who “never revises” arouses even
more poignant despair. The laborious Balzac<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
tearing his proofs to pieces seems only a dingy
and pitiable figure. Nobody knows the difference,
and what’s a well-turned sentence more
or less? I saw recently a newspaper editorial
commenting derisively on a novelist’s confession
that he was capable of only a thousand
words a day, the point being that the average
newspaper writer triples this output without
fatigue. Newcomers in the field can hardly
fail to be impressed by these rumors of novels
knocked off in a month or three months, for
which astonishing sums have been paid by
generous magazine editors. We shall have better
fiction as soon as ambitious writers realize
that novel-writing is a high calling, and that
success is to be won only by those who are
willing to serve seven and yet seven other years
in the hope of winning “the crown of time.”</p>

<p>In his happy characterization of Turgenieff
and his relation to the younger French school
of realists, Mr. James speaks of the “great
back-garden of his Slav imagination and his
Germanic culture, into which the door constantly
stood open, and the grandsons of Balzac
were not, I think, particularly free to accompany<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
him.” I am further indebted to Mr.
James for certain words uttered by M. Renan
of the big Russian: “His conscience was not
that of an individual to whom nature had been
more or less generous; it was in some sort the
conscience of a people. Before he was born
he had lived for thousands of years; infinite
successions of reveries had amassed themselves
in the depths of his heart. No man has
been as much as he the incarnation of a whole
race: generations of ancestors, lost in the sleep
of centuries, speechless, came through him to
life and utterance.”</p>

<p>I make no apology for thrusting my tin
dipper again into Mr. James’s bubbling well
for an anecdote of Flaubert, derived from Edmond
de Goncourt. Flaubert was missed one
fine afternoon in a house where he and De
Goncourt were guests, and was found to have
undressed and gone to bed to <i>think</i>!</p>

<p>I shall not give comfort to the enemy by
any admission that our novelists lack culture
in the sense that Turgenieff and the great
French masters possessed it. A matter of which
I may complain with more propriety is their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
lack of “information” (and I hope this term
is sufficiently delicate) touching the tasks and
aims of America. We have been deluged with
“big” novels that are “big” only in the publishers’
advertisements. New York has lately
been the scene of many novels, but the New
York adumbrated in most of them is only the
metropolis as exposed to the awed gaze of provincial
tourists from the rubber-neck wagon.
Sex, lately discovered for exploitation, has resulted
only in “arrangements” of garbage in
pink and yellow, lightly sprinkled with musk.</p>

<p>As Rosinante stumbles over the range I am
disposed to offer a few suggestions for the
benefit of those who may ask where, then,
lies the material about which our novelists
are so deficient in “information.” No strong
hand has yet been laid upon our industrial life.
It has been pecked at and trifled with, but
never treated with breadth or fulness. Here
we have probably the most striking social contrasts
the world has ever seen; racial mixtures of
bewildering complexity, the whole flung against
impressive backgrounds and lighted from a
thousand angles. Pennsylvania is only slightly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
“spotted” on the literary map, and yet between
Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, nearly every possible
phase and condition of life is represented.
Great passions are at work in the fiery aisles of
the steel mills that would have kindled Dostoiefsky’s
imagination. A pillar of cloud by day
and of fire by night marks a limitless field for
the earnest fictionist. A Balzac would find
innumerable subjects awaiting him in the streets
of Wilkesbarre!</p>

<p>At this point I must bemoan the ill-fortune
that has carried so many American fiction
writers to foreign shores. If Hawthorne had
never seen Italy, but had clung to Salem, I
am disposed to think American literature would
be the richer. If fate had not borne Mr.
Howells to Venice, but had posted him on the
Ohio during the mighty struggle of the ’60’s,
and if Mr. James had been stationed at Chicago,
close to the deep currents of national
feeling, what a monumental library of vital
fiction they might have given us! If Mrs. Wharton’s
splendid gifts had been consecrated to
the service of Pittsburgh rather than New
York and Paris, how much greater might be
our debt to her!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>Business in itself is not interesting; business
as it reacts upon character is immensely interesting.
Mineral paint has proved to be an
excellent preservative for <i>The Rise of Silas
Lapham</i>, which remains our best novel of business.
But if paint may be turned to account,
why not cotton, wool, and the rest of the trade
catalogue, every item with its own distinct
genesis? In <i>The Turmoil</i> Mr. Tarkington staged,
under a fitting canopy of factory smoke, a significant
drama of the conflict between idealism
and materialism.</p>

<p>Turning to our preoccupation with politics,
we find another field that is all but fallow.
Few novels of any real dignity may be tendered
as exhibits in this department, and these
are in a sense local—the comprehensive, the
deeply searching, has yet to be done. Mr.
Churchill’s <i>Coniston</i>, and Mr. Brand Whitlock’s
<i>The Thirteenth District</i> are the happiest experiments
I recall, though possibly there are others
of equal importance. Yet politics is not only a
matter of constant discussion in every quarter,
but through and by politics many thousands
solve the problem of existence. Alone of great
national capitals Washington has never been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
made the scene of a novel of distinction. Years
ago we had Mrs. Burnett’s <i>Through One Administration</i>,
but it failed to establish itself as a
classic. George Meredith would have found
much in Washington life upon which to exercise
his ironic powers.</p>

<p>With all our romantic longings it is little
short of amazing that we are not more fecund
in schemes for romantic drama and fiction.
The stage, not to say the market, waits; but
the settings are dingy from much use and the
characters in threadbare costumes strut forth
to speak old familiar lines. Again, there is an
old superstition that we are a humorous people,
and yet humor is curiously absent from recent
fiction. “O. Henry” knew the way to the fountain
of laughter, but contented himself with
the shorter form; <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> seems destined
to stand as our nearest approach to a
novel of typical humor. We have had David
Harums and Mrs. Wiggses a-plenty—kindly
philosophers, often drawn with skill—but the
results are character sketches, not novels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span></p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>It is impossible in a general view of our fiction
to dissociate the novel from the short
story, which, in a way, has sapped its vitality.
An astonishing number of short stories have
shown a grasp of the movement, energy, and
color of American life, but writers who have
succeeded in this field have seemed incapable
of longer flight. And the originality possessed
by a great number of short-story writers seems
to be shared only meagrely by those who experiment
with the novel. When some venturesome
Martian explores the Library of Congress
it may be that in the short-story division he will
find the surest key to what American life has
been. There are few American novels of any
period that can tip the scale against the twenty
best American short stories, chosen for sincerity
and workmanship. It would seem that our creative
talent is facile and true in miniature studies,
but shrinks from an ampler canvas and a broader
brush. Frank Norris’s <i>The Pit</i> and <i>The Octopus</i>
continue to command respect from the fact
that he had a panoramic sense that led him to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
exercise his fine talents upon a great and important
theme.</p>

<p>We have had, to be sure, many examples
of the business and political novel, but practically
all of them have been struck from the
same die. A “big” politician or a “big” man of
business, his daughter, and a lover who brazenly
sets himself up to correct the morals of the
powerful parent, is a popular device. Young
love must suffer, but it must not meet with
frustration. In these experiments (if anything
so rigidly prescribed may be said to contain
any element of experiment) a little realism is
sweetened with much romance. In the same
way the quasi-historical novel for years followed
a stereotyped formula: the lover was
preferably a Northern spy within the Southern
lines; the heroine, a daughter of the traditional
aristocratic Southern family. Her shuddersome
ride to seek General Lee’s pardon for
the unfortunate officer condemned to be shot
at daybreak was as inevitable as measles.
The geography might be reversed occasionally
to give a Northern girl a chance, but in any
event her brother’s animosity toward the hero<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
was always a pleasing factor. Another ancient
formula lately revived with slight variations
gives us a shaggy, elemental man brought by
shipwreck or other means into contact with
gentle womanhood. In his play <i>The Great Divide</i>
William Vaughn Moody invested this device
with dignity and power, but it would be interesting
to see what trick might be performed
with the same cards if the transformed hero
should finally take his departure for the bright
boulevards, while the heroine seized his bow
and arrow and turned joyfully to the wilderness.</p>

<p>When our writers cease their futile experimenting
and imitating, and wake up to the
possibilities of American material we shall
have fewer complaints of the impotence of the
American novel. We are just a little impatient
of the holding of the mirror up to nature, but
nevertheless we do not like to be fooled
all the time. And no one is quicker than an
American to “get down to brass tacks,” when
he realizes that he must come to it. Realism
is the natural medium through which a democracy
may “register” (to borrow a term from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
the screen-drama) its changing emotions, its
hopes and failures. We are willing to take our
recreations in imaginary kingdoms, but we
are blessed with a healthy curiosity as to what
really is happening among our teeming millions,
and are not so blind as our foreign critics
and the croakers at home would have us think
as to what we do and feel and believe. But
the realists must play the game straight. They
must paint the wart on the sitter’s nose—though
he refuse to pay for the portrait! Half-hearted
dallying and sidling and compromising
are not getting us anywhere. The flimsiest
romance is preferable to dishonest realism.
It is the meretricious stuff in the guise of realism
that we are all anxious to delete from the
catalogues.</p>

<p>Having thus, I hope, appeased the realists,
who are an exacting phalanx, difficult to satisfy,
I feel that it is only right, just, and proper to
rally for a moment the scampering hosts of
the romanticists. It is deplorable that Realism
should be so roused to bloodthirstiness by any
intrusion upon the landscape of Romanticism’s
dainty frocks and fluttering ribbons. Before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
Realism was, Romance ruled in many kingdoms.
If Romance had not been, Realism would
not be. Let the Cossacks keep to their side of
the river and behave like gentlemen! Others
have said it who spoke with authority, and I
shall not scruple to repeat that the story for
the story’s sake is a perfectly decent, honorable,
and praiseworthy thing. It is as old as
human nature, and the desire for it will not
perish till man has been recreated. Neither
much argument about it, nor the limning
against the gray Russian sky-line of the august
figures of Dostoiefsky, Tolstoy, and Turgenieff
will change the faith of the many who seek in
fiction cheer and recreation.</p>

<p>Again, I beg, let us preserve a good temper
as we ponder these matters. More and more
we shall have true realism; but more and more
let us hope for the true romance. Stevenson’s
familiar contributions to the discussion are in
the best vein of the cause he espouses; and although
a New York newspaper referred to
him the other day as the “Caledonian <i>poseur</i>,”
his lantern-bearers continue to signal merrily
from the heights and are not to be confused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
with Realism’s switch targets in the railroad
yards in the valley. The lords of the high pale
brow in classrooms and on the critical dais are
much too contemptuous of Romance. Romance
we must have, to the end of time, no matter
how nobly Realism may achieve. With our predisposition
as a healthy-minded and cheerful
people toward tales of the night-rider and the
scratch of the whip butt on the inn door, it is
unfair to slap Romance on the wrist and post
her off to bed like a naughty stepchild. Even
the stern brow of the realist must relax at times.</p>

<p>Many people of discernment found pleasure
in our Richard Carvels, Janice Merediths, and
Hugh Wynnes. Miss Johnston’s <i>To Have and
to Hold</i> and <i>Lewis Rand</i> are books one may
enjoy without shame. The stickler for style
need not be scornful of Mrs. Catherwood’s
<i>Lazarre</i> and <i>The Romance of Dollard</i>. Out of
Chicago came Mr. Henry Fuller’s charming
exotic, <i>The Chevalier of Piensieri-Vani</i>. <i>Monsieur
Beaucaire</i> and Miss Sherwood’s <i>Daphne</i>
proved a while ago that all the cherries have
not been shaken from the tree—only the trees
in these cases, unfortunately, were not American.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
Surely one of these days a new Peter Pan
will fly over an American greenwood. I should
bless the hand that pressed upon me for reading
to-night so diverting a skit as Mr. Vielé’s
<i>The Inn of the Silver Moon</i>. I shall not even
pause to argue with those who are plucking
my coat-tails and whispering that these are
mere trifles, too frivolous to be mentioned
when the novel is the regular order of the conference.
I am looking along the shelf for Stockton,
the fanciful and whimsical. How pleasant
it would be to meet Mrs. Leeks and Mrs. Aleshine
again, or to lodge for a day at another
Squirrel Inn. And yet (O fame, thou fickle
one!) when I asked a young lady the other
day if she knew Stockton, she replied with
emphasis that she did not; that “that old
quaint stuff doesn’t go any more!”</p>

<p>Having handed Realism a ticket to Pittsburgh
with generous stop-over privileges, I
regret that I am unable to point Romance
to any such promising terminus. But the realm
of Romance is extra-territorial; Realism alone
demands the surveyor’s certificate and abstracts
of title. An Irish poet once assured me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
that fairies are to be found everywhere, and
surely somewhere between Moosehead Lake
and Puget Sound some lad is piping lustily
on a new silver whistle where the deer come
down to drink.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>It is the fashion to attribute to the automobile
and the motion-picture all social phenomena
not otherwise accounted for. The
former has undoubtedly increased our national
restlessness, and it has robbed the evening
lamp of its cosey bookish intimacy. The screen-drama
makes possible the “reading” of a story
with the minimum amount of effort. A generation
bred on the “movies” will be impatient
of the tedious methods of writers who cannot
transform character by a click of the camera,
but require at least four hundred pages to turn
the trick. It is doubtful whether any of the
quasi-historical novels that flourished fifteen
and twenty years ago and broke a succession
of best-selling records would meet with anything
approximating the same amiable reception
if launched to-day. A trained scenario-writer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
unembarrassed by literary standards and
intent upon nothing but action, can beat the
melodramatic novelist at his own game every
time. A copyright novel of adventure cannot
compete with the same story at ten cents or
a quarter as presented in the epileptic drama,
where it lays no burden upon the beholder’s
visualizing sense. The resources of the screen
for creating thrills are inexhaustible; it draws
upon the heavens above, the earth beneath,
and the waters under the earth; and as nothing
that can be pictured can be untrue—or so the
confiding “movie” patron, unfamiliar with the
tricks of the business, believes—the screen has
also the great advantage of plausibility.</p>

<p>The silent drama may therefore exercise a
beneficent influence, if it shall prove to have
shunted into a new channel of publication
great numbers of stories whose justification
between covers was always debatable. Already
many novels of this type have been resurrected
by the industrious screen producers. If, after
the long list has been exhausted, we shall be
spared the “novelization” of screen scenarios
in the fashion of the novelized play, we shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
be rid of some of the débris that has handicapped
the novelists who have meekly asked
to be taken seriously.</p>

<p>The fiction magazines also have cut into the
sale of ephemeral novels. For the price of one
novel the uncritical reader may fortify himself
with enough reading matter to keep him
diverted for a month. Nowadays the hurrying
citizen approaches the magazine counter in much
the same spirit in which he attacks the help-yourself
lunch-trough—grabs what he likes and
retires for hurried consumption. It must, however,
be said for the much-execrated magazine
editors that with all their faults and defaults
they are at least alive to the importance and
value of American material. They discovered
O. Henry, now recognized as a writer of significance.
I should like to scribble a marginal note
at this point to the effect that writers who are
praised for style, those who are able to employ
<i>otiose</i>, <i>meticulous</i>, and <i>ineluctable</i> with awe-inspiring
inadvertence in tales of morbid introspection,
are not usually those who are deeply
learned in the ways and manners of that considerable
body of our people who are obliged to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
work for a living. We must avoid snobbishness
in our speculations as to the available ingredients
from which American fiction must be
made. Baseball players, vaudeville and motion-picture
performers, ladies employed as commercial
travellers, and Potash and Perlmutter,
are all legitimate subjects for the fictionist,
and our millions undoubtedly prefer just now
to view them humorously or romantically.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>In our righteous awakening to the serious
plight to which our fiction has come it is not
necessary, nor is it becoming, to point the slow
unmoving finger of scorn at those benighted
but well-meaning folk who in times past did
what they could toward fashioning an American
literature. We all see their errors now;
we deplore their stupidity, we wish they had
been quite different; but why drag their bones
from the grave for defilement? Cooper and
Irving meant well; there are still misguided
souls who find pleasure in them. It was not
Hawthorne’s fault that he so bungled <i>The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
Scarlet Letter</i>, nor Poe’s that he frittered away
his time inventing the detective story. Our
deep contrition must not betray us into hardness
of heart toward those unconscious sinners,
who cooled their tea in the saucer and never
heard of a samovar!</p>

<p>There are American novelists whose portraits
I refuse to turn to the wall. Marion Crawford
had very definite ideas, which he set forth
in a most entertaining essay, as to what the
novel should be, and he followed his formula
with happy results. His <i>Saracinesca</i> still seems
to me a fine romance. There was some marrow
in the bones of E. W. Howe’s <i>Story of a Country
Town</i>. I can remember when Miss Woolson
was highly regarded as a writer, and when
Miss Howard’s amusing <i>One Summer</i> seemed
not an ignoble thing. F. J. Stimson, Thomas
Nelson Page, Arthur Sherburne Hardy, Miss
Murfree, Mary Hallock Foote, T. B. Aldrich,
T. R. Sullivan, H. C. Bunner, Robert Grant,
and Harold Frederic all labored sincerely for
the cause of American fiction. F. Hopkinson
Smith told a good story and told it like a gentleman.
Mr. Cable’s right to a place in the front<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
rank of American novelists is not, I believe,
questioned in any survey; if <i>The Grandissimes</i>
and <i>Old Creole Days</i> had been written in France,
he would probably be pointed to as an author
well worthy of American emulation.</p>

<p>No doubt this list might be considerably
expanded, as I am drawing from memory,
and merely suggesting writers whose performances
in most instances synchronize with my
first reading of American novels. I do not believe
we are helping our case materially by
ignoring these writers as though they were a
lot of poor relations whenever a foreign critic
turns his condescending gaze in our direction.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>It is a hopeful sign that we now produce
one or two, or maybe three, good novels a year.
The number is bound to increase as our young
writers of ambition realize that technic and
facility are not the only essentials of success,
but that they must burrow into life—honeycomb
it until their explorations carry them
to the core of it. There are novels that are half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
good; some are disfigured by wabbly characterizations;
or the patience necessary to a proper
development of the theme is lacking. However,
sincerity and an appreciation of the highest
function of the novel as a medium for interpreting
life are not so rare as the critics would
have us believe.</p>

<p>I have never subscribed to the idea that
the sun of American literature rises in Indiana
and sets in Kansas. We have had much provincial
fiction, and the monotony of our output
would be happily varied by attempts at
something of national scope. It is not to disparage
the small picture that I suggest for
experiment the broadly panoramic—“A Hugo
flare against the night”—but because the novel
as we practise it seems so pitifully small in
contrast with the available material. I am
aware, of course, that a hundred pages are as
good as a thousand if the breath of life is in
them. Flaubert, says Mr. James, <i>made</i> things
big.</p>

<p>We must escape from this carving of cherry
stones, this contentment with the day of littleness,
this use of the novel as a plaything where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
it pretends to be something else. And it occurs
to me at this juncture that I might have saved
myself a considerable expenditure of ink by
stating in the first place that what the American
novel really needs is a Walt Whitman
to fling a barbaric yawp from the crest of the
Alleghanies and proclaim a new freedom. For
what I have been trying to say comes down
to this: that we shall not greatly serve ourselves
or the world’s literature by attempts to
Russianize, or Gallicize, or Anglicize our fiction,
but that we must strive more earnestly to
Americanize it—to make it express with all
the art we may command the life we are living
and that pretty tangible something that
we call the American spirit.</p>

<p>The bright angels of letters never appear in
answer to prayer; they come out of nowhere
and knock at unwatched gates. But the wailing
of jeremiads before the high altar is not calculated
to soften the hearts of the gods who
hand down genius from the skies. It is related
that a clerk in the patent office asked to be
assigned to a post in some other department
on the ground that practically everything had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
been invented and he wanted to change before
he lost his job. That was in 1833.</p>

<p>Courage, comrade! The songs have not all
been written nor the tales all told.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE CHURCH FOR HONEST SINNERS</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE young man who greeted me cheerfully
in the lobby of the hotel in Warburton,
my native town, and handed
me a card setting forth the hours of services
at St. John’s Church, evidently assumed that
I was a commercial traveller. I was in no wise
offended by his mistake, as I sincerely admire
the heralds of prosperity and sit with them at
meat whenever possible. I am a neurologist by
profession, but write occasionally, and was
engaged just then in gathering material for a
magazine article on occupational diseases. A
friend in the Department of Labor had suggested
Warburton as a likely hunting-ground,
as children employed there in a match-factory
were constantly being poisoned, and a paint-factory
also was working dire injury to its
employees.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid,” I replied to the engaging young
representative of St. John’s Men’s League,
“that my religious views wouldn’t be tolerated
at St. John’s. But I thank you, just the same.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>I had been baptized in St. John’s and remembered
it well from my youth. On my way
up-town from the station I had noted its handsome
new edifice of impeccable Gothic.</p>

<p>“We have the best music in town, and our
minister is a live wire. He knows how to preach
to men—he’s cut big slices out of the other
churches.”</p>

<p>“Gives the anxious sinner a clean bill of
health, does he?”</p>

<p>“Well, most of the leading citizens go there
now,” he answered, politely ignoring my uncalled-for
irony. “Men who never went to
church before; the men who do things in Warburton.
Our minister’s the best preacher in the
diocese. His subject this morning is ‘The Prodigal
Son.’”</p>

<p>I felt guiltily that the topic might have been
chosen providentially to mark my return, and
it occurred to me that this might be a good
chance to see Warburton in its best bib and
tucker. However, having planned to spend the
morning in the slum which the town had acquired
with its prosperity, I hardened my heart
against the young solicitor, in spite of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
unobtrusive and courteous manner of extending
the invitation.</p>

<p>“You represent a saint’s church,” I remarked,
glancing at the card. “I travel a good
deal and I haven’t found a church specially
designed for sinners like me. I’m uncomfortable
among the saints. I’m not quarrelling
with your church or its name, but I’ve long
had a feeling that our church nomenclature
needs revision. Still, that’s a personal matter.
You’ve done your duty by me, and I’d be glad
to come if I didn’t have another engagement.”</p>

<p>The pages of a Chicago morning newspaper
that lay across my knees probably persuaded
him that I was lying. However, after a moment’s
hesitation he sat down beside me.</p>

<p>“That’s funny, what you said about a church
for sinners—but we have one right here in
Warburton; odd you never heard of it! It was
written up in the newspapers a good deal. It’s
just across the street from St. John’s on Water
Street.”</p>

<p>I recalled now that I had seen a strange
church in my walk to the hotel, but the new
St. John’s had so absorbed my attention that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
I had passed it with only a glance. It came
back to me that it was a white wooden structure,
and that boards were nailed across its
pillared portico as though to shut out the
public while repairs were in progress.</p>

<p>“Saints excluded, sinners only need apply?”</p>

<p>He nodded, and looked at me queerly, as
though, now that I had broached the matter,
he considered the advisability of telling me
more. It was ten o’clock and half a dozen
church-bells clanged importunately as a background
for the <i>Adeste Fideles</i> rung from St.
John’s chimes.</p>

<p>“‘The Church For Honest Sinners,’ might
suit you, only it’s closed—closed for good, I
guess,” he remarked, again scrutinizing me
closely.</p>

<p>He played nervously with a pack of cards
similar to the one with which he had introduced
himself. Other men, quite as unmistakably
transients as I, were lounging down from
breakfast, settling themselves to their newspapers,
or seeking the barber-shop. Something
in my attitude toward the church for which he
was seeking worshippers seemed to arrest him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
He was a handsome, clear-eyed, wholesome-looking
young fellow, whose life had doubtless
been well sheltered from evil; there was something
refreshingly naïve about him. I liked
his straightforward manner of appealing to
strangers; a bank teller, perhaps, or maybe
a clerk in the office of one of the manufacturing
companies whose indifference to the welfare
of their laborers I had come to investigate.
Not the most grateful of tasks, this of passing
church advertisements about in hotel lobbies
on Sunday mornings. It requires courage, true
manliness. My heart warmed to him as I saw
a number of men eying us from the cigar-stand,
evidently amused that the young fellow
had cornered me. A member of the group,
a stout gentleman in checks, held one of the
cards in his hand and covertly pointed with
it in our direction.</p>

<p>“If there’s a story about the sinners’ church
I’d like to hear it,” I remarked encouragingly.
“It seemed to be closed—suppose they’re enlarging
it to accommodate the rush.”</p>

<p>“Well, no; hardly that,” he replied soberly.
“It was built as an independent scheme—none<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
of the denominations would stand for it of
course.”</p>

<p>“Why the ‘of course’?”</p>

<p>“Well,” he smiled, “the idea of sin isn’t
exactly popular, is it? And besides everybody
isn’t wicked; there are plenty of good people.
There’s good in all men,” he added, as though
quoting.</p>

<p>“I can’t quarrel with that. But how about
this Church For Honest Sinners? Tell me the
story.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a queer sort of story, and as you’re
a stranger and I’m not likely to meet you again,
I’ll tell you all I know. It was built by a
woman.” He crossed his legs and looked at
the clock. “She was rich as riches go in a town
like this. And she was different from other
people. She was left a widow with about a hundred
thousand dollars, and she set apart half
of it to use in helping others. She wouldn’t do
it through societies or churches; she did it all
herself. She wasn’t very religious—not the way
we use the word—not the usual sort of church
woman who’s zealous in guilds and societies and
enjoys running things. She wasn’t above asking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
the factory hands to her house now and
then, and was always helping the under dog.
She was splendid—the finest woman that ever
lived; but of course people thought her queer.”</p>

<p>“Such people are generally considered eccentric,”
I commented.</p>

<p>“The business men disliked her because
they said she was spoiling the poor people and
putting bad notions into their heads.”</p>

<p>“I dare say they did! I can see that a woman
like that would be criticised.”</p>

<p>“Then when they tore down old St. John’s
and began building the new church, she said
she’d build a church after her own ideas. She
spent twenty-five thousand dollars building
that church you noticed in Water Street and
she called it ‘The Church For Honest Sinners.’
She meant to put a minister in who had some
of her ideas about religion, but right there
came her first blow. As her church wasn’t tied
up to any of the denominations she couldn’t
find a man willing to take the job. I suppose
the real trouble was that nobody wanted
to mix up with a scheme like that; it was too
radical; didn’t seem exactly respectable. It’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
easy, I suppose, when there’s a big whooping
crowd—Billy Sunday and that sort of thing—and
the air is full of emotionalism, to get people
to the mourners’ bench to confess that they’re
miserable sinners. But you can see for yourself
that it takes nerve to walk into the door of a
church that’s for sinners only—seems sort o’
foolish!</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t be telling you about this if I
hadn’t seen that you had the same idea the
builder of that church had: that there’s too
much of the saint business and general smugness
about our churches, and that a church
that frankly set out to welcome sinners would
play, so to speak, to capacity. You might think
that all the Cains, Judases, and Magdalens
would feel that here at last was a door of Christian
hope flung open for them. But it doesn’t
work that way—at least it didn’t in this case.
I suppose there are people in this town right
now, all dressed up to go to church, who’ve
broken all the Ten Commandments without
feeling they were sinners; and of course the
churches can’t go after sin the way they used
to, with hell and brimstone; the people won’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
stand for it. You’ve been thinking that a church
set apart for sinners would appeal to people
who’ve done wrong and are sorry about it,
but it doesn’t; and that’s why that church on
Water Street’s boarded up—not for repairs,
as you imagined, but because only one person
has ever crossed the threshold. It was the idea
of the woman who built it that the door should
stand open all the time, night and day, and
the minister, if she could have found one to
take the job, would have been on the lookout
to help the people who went there.”</p>

<p>This was rather staggering. Perhaps, I reflected,
it is better after all to suffer the goats
to pasture, with such demureness as they can
command, among the sheep.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” I remarked, “that the founder
of the church was satisfied with her experiment—she
hadn’t wholly wasted her money,
for she had found the answers to interesting
questions as to human nature—the vanity of
rectitude, the pride of virtue, the consolations
of hypocrisy.”</p>

<p>He looked at me questioningly, with his
frank innocent eyes, as though estimating the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
extent to which he might carry his confidences.</p>

<p>“Let me say again that I shouldn’t be telling
you all this if you didn’t have her ideas—and
without ever knowing her! She lived on the
corner below the church, where she could watch
the door. She watched it for about two years,
day and night, without ever seeing a soul go
in, and people thought she’d lost her mind.
And then, one Sunday morning when the whole
town—all her old friends and neighbors—were
bound for church, she came out of her house
alone and walked straight down to that church
she had built for sinners, and in at the door.</p>

<p>“You see,” he said, rising quickly, as though
recalling his obligations to St. John’s Men’s
League, “she was the finest woman in town—the
best and the noblest woman that ever lived!
They found her at noon lying dead in the
church. The failure of her plan broke her heart;
and that made it pretty hard—for her family—everybody.”</p>

<p>He was fingering his cards nervously, and I
did not question the sincerity of the emotion
his face betrayed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>“It is possible,” I suggested, “that she had
grown morbid over some sin of her own, and
had been hoping that others would avail themselves
of the hospitality of a church that was
frankly open to sinners. It might have made
it easier for <i>her</i>.”</p>

<p>He smiled with a childlike innocence and
faith.</p>

<p>“Not only not possible,” he caught me up,
with quick dignity, “but incredible! She was
my mother.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE SECOND-RATE MAN IN<br>
POLITICS</h2>

<p class="ph1">[1916]</p>

</div>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>In our great modern States, where the scale of things
is so large, it does seem as if the remnant might be so increased
as to become an actual power, even though the
majority be unsound.—<span class="smcap">Matthew Arnold</span>, <i>Numbers</i>.</p>
</div>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">WHO governs America?</p>

<p>The answer is obvious: we are a
republic, a representative democracy
enjoying to the utmost government of, for, and
by the people. America is governed by persons
we choose, presumably on our own initiative, to
serve us, to make, execute, and interpret laws
for us. Addicted as we are to the joy of phrases,
we find in these <i>clichés</i> unfailing delight.</p>

<p>Democracy, ideally considered, is an affair
of the wisest and best. As the privileges of the
ballot are generously extended to all, the whole
people are invested with an initiative and an
authority which it is their duty to exercise.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
We assume that all are proud of their inheritance
of liberty, jealous of their power, and
alert in performing the duties of citizenship.
That we are not highly successful in realizing
this ideal is a matter that is giving increasing
concern to thoughtful Americans.</p>

<p>As these words are read thousands of candidates
are before the electorate for consideration,
and the patriotic citizen is presumably
possessing himself of all available information
regarding them, determined to vote only for
the most desirable. The parties have done their
best, or worst, as we choose to view the matter,
and it is “up to the people” to accept or reject
those who offer themselves for place. The
citizen is face to face with the problem, Shall
he vote for candidates he knows to be unfit,
merely to preserve his regularity, or shall he
cast his ballot for the fittest men without respect
to the party emblems on his ballot? Opposed
to the conscientious voter, and capable
of defeating his purpose, are agencies and influences
with which it is well-nigh impossible
for him to cope. The higher his intelligence and
the nobler his aim, the less he is able to reckon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
with forces which are stubbornly determined
to nullify his vote.</p>

<p>The American voter is not normally independent;
it is only when there has been some
marked affront to the party’s intelligence or
moral sense that we observe any display of
independence. Independent movements are always
reassuring and encouraging. The revolt
against Blaine in 1884, the Gold-Democratic
movement in 1896, were most significant; and
I am disposed to give a somewhat similar value
to the Progressive movement of 1912. But the
average voter is a creature of prejudice, who
boasts jauntily that he never scratches his
ticket. He follows his party with dogged submission
and is more or less honestly blind to
its faults.</p>

<p>As my views on this subject are more usually
voiced by independents than by partisans, it
may not be amiss to say that I am a party
man, a Democrat, sufficiently “regular” to
vote with a good conscience in primary elections.
Living in a State where there is no point
of rest in politics, where one campaign dovetails
into another, I have for twenty-five years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
been an observer of political tendencies and
methods. I may say of the two great parties,
as Ingersoll remarked of the life beyond, “I
have friends in both places.” One of my best
friends was a “boss” who served a term in
prison for scratching a tally-sheet. I am perfectly
familiar with the theories upon which
bossism is justified, the more plausible being
that only by maintaining strong local organizations,
that is to say, Machines, can a party so
intrench itself as to support effectively the
policies and reforms dear to the heart of the
idealist. And bosses do, indeed, sometimes use
their power benevolently, though this happens
usually where they see a chance to win advantage
or to allay popular clamor.</p>

<p>It is not of the pending campaign that I
write, and any references I make to it are only
for the purpose of illustrating phases or tendencies
that seem worthy of consideration at
a time when public thought is concentrated
upon politics. And to give definite aim to this
inquiry I shall state it in the harshest terms
possible:</p>

<p>We, a self-governing people, permit our affairs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
to be administered, very largely, by second-rate
men.</p>

<p>Our hearts throb indignantly as we ponder
this. The types have a queer look. Such an accusation
is an unpardonable sin against American
institutions—against an intelligent, high-minded
citizenry. It can, however, do no harm
to view the matter from various angles to determine
whether anything really may be adduced
in support of it.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>In theory the weight of the majority is with
the fit. This is the pleasantest of ideas, but it
is not true. It is not true at least in so great a
number of contests as to justify any virtuous
complacency in the electorate. It is probably
no more untrue now than in other years, though
the cumulative effect of a long experience of
government by the unfit is having its effect
upon the nation in discouraging faith in that
important and controlling function of government
that has to do with the choice and election
of candidates. Only rarely—and I speak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
carefully—do the best men possible for a given
office ever reach it. The best men are never
even considered for thousands of State, county,
and municipal elective offices; they do not
offer themselves, either because office-holding
is distasteful, or because private business is
more lucrative, or because they are aware of
no demand for their services on the part of
their fellow citizens. By fitness I mean the competence
produced by experience and training,
fortified with moral character and a sense of
responsibility. I should say that a fit man for
public office is one who in his private affairs
has established a reputation for efficiency and
trustworthiness.</p>

<p>In assuming that a democracy like ours presupposes
in the electorate a desire, no matter
how feeble, to intrust public affairs to men of
fitness, to first-rate men, it would seem that
with the approach of every presidential campaign
numbers of possible candidates would receive
consideration as eligible to our highest
office. It will be said that just as many candidates
were available in 1916 as at any other
period in our history, but this is neither conclusive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
nor heartening: there should be more!
It cannot be pretended that public service does
not attract thousands of men; it can, however,
be complained that the offices fall very largely
to the inferior.</p>

<p>We have just witnessed the spectacle of a
great republic, which confides the broadest
powers to its chief executive, strangely limited
in its choice of candidates for the presidency
to a handful of men. No new commanding
figure had sprung forward from the ranks of
either party in the most trying period the country
has known in fifty years. If Mr. Wilson’s
renomination had not been inevitable, it would
be very difficult to name another Democrat
who, by virtue of demonstrated strength and
public confidence, would have been able to
enter the lists against him. Our only Democratic
Presidents since the Civil War stepped
from a governor’s seat to the higher office;
but I know of no Democratic governor who, in
1916, could have entered the national convention
supported by any appreciable public demand
for his nomination. And no Democratic
senator could have debated Mr. Wilson’s claims<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
to further recognition. Speaker Clark, with the
prestige of his maximum five hundred and fifty-six
votes on the tenth ballot of the Baltimore
Convention, might have been able to reappear
at St. Louis with a similar showing; but the
Democratic range of possibilities certainly had
not widened. To be sure, Mr. Bryan would
have remained to reckon with; but, deeply as
the party and the country is indebted to him
for his courageous stand against the bosses at
Baltimore, he could hardly have received a
fourth nomination.</p>

<p>The Republicans were in no better case when
their convention met at Chicago. The Old
Guard was stubbornly resolved, not only that
Mr. Roosevelt should not be nominated, but
that he should not dictate the choice of a Republican
candidate. A short distance from the
scene of their deliberations, the Progressives,
having failed to establish themselves as a permanent
contestant of the older parties, tenaciously
clung to their leader. Mr. Roosevelt’s
effort to interest the Republicans in Senator
Lodge as a compromise candidate fell upon
deaf ears. Mr. Hughes’s high qualifications may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
not be seriously questioned. He is a first-rate
man, and the lack of enthusiasm with which
his nomination was received by the perfectly
ordered and controlled body of delegates is
not to his discredit. Sore beset, the Old Guard
put forth a candidate little to their taste, one
who, if elected, would, we must assume, prove
quite impatient of the harness fashioned for
Presidents by the skilled armorers of the good
old days of backward-looking Republicanism.</p>

<p>In taking from the bench a gentleman who
was “out of politics” the Republicans emphasized
their lamentable lack of available
candidates. Nothing was ever sadder than the
roll-call of States for the nomination of “favorite
sons.” Estimable though these men are, no
one could have listened to the nominating
speeches and witnessed the subsequent mechanical
demonstrations without depression.
None of these nominees had the slightest
chance; the orators who piped their little lays
in praise of them knew they had not; the vast
audience that witnessed the proceedings, perfectly
aware of the farcical nature of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
banalities, knew they had not, and viewed the
show with contemptuous amusement.</p>

<p>The heartiness of the reception accorded
Messrs. Depew and Cannon, who were called
upon to entertain the audience during a lull
in the proceedings, was not without its pathos.
They dwelt upon the party’s past glories with
becoming poignancy. Mr. Borah, tactfully projected
as a representative of a newer order of
Republicanism, was far less effective. The convention
was greatly stirred by no new voice;
no new leader flashed upon the stage to quicken
it to new and high endeavor. No less inspired
or inspiring body of men ever gathered than
those who constituted the Republican Convention
of 1916.</p>

<p>I asked a successful lawyer the other day
how he accounted for the lack of presidential
timber. “It’s because the average American
would rather be president of the Pennsylvania
Railroad than of the United States,” he answered.
And it is true, beyond question, that
our highest genius is employed in commerce
and business rather than in politics. If we, the
people, do not seek means of promoting administrative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
wisdom and efficiency in our government
we shall pay one of these days a high
price for our indifference. There is danger ahead
unless we are disposed to take our politics more
seriously, and unless more young men of the
best talent and the highest aims can be lured
into public life. The present showing is certainly
not encouraging as to the future of American
statesmanship; and to say that the fit have
always been few, is not a particularly consoling
answer.</p>

<p>It is true of a period still susceptible of intimate
scrutiny—say, from the Civil War—that
presidential candidates have been chosen in
every case from a small group of potentialities
in both parties. We have established (stupidly
in any large view of the matter) geographical
limitations upon the possible choice that greatly
narrow the field. Candidates for the presidency
must be chosen with an eye to the local effect,
from States essential to success. Though Mr.
Blaine’s candidacy was surrounded by unusual
circumstances, it emphasizes, nevertheless,
the importance to the parties of nominating
men from the “pivotal” States. We have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
had no New England President since Franklin
Pierce. This is not because the New England
States have not produced men of fitness, but
is attributable solely to the small representation
of the Northeastern States in the Electoral
College.</p>

<p>The South, likewise, has long been eliminated
from the reckoning. Though born in Virginia
Mr. Wilson is distinctly not “a Southern man”
in the familiar connotations of that term. In
old times the Southern States contributed men
of the first rank to both houses of Congress;
but, apart from Mr. Underwood (who received
one hundred and seventeen and one-half votes
at Baltimore) and Mr. John Sharp Williams,
there are no Southerners of conspicuous attainments
in the present Senate. The Southern bar
embraces now, perhaps as truly as at any earlier
period, lawyers of distinguished ability, but
they apparently do not find public life attractive.</p>

<p>No President has yet been elected from beyond
the Mississippi, though Mr. Bryan, thrice
a candidate, widened the area of choice westward.
In the present year Governor Johnson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
and Senator Borah were the only trans-Mississippi
men mentioned as possibilities, and
they cut no figure in the contest. We are still
a congeries of States, or groups of States, rather
than a nation, with a resulting political provincialism
that is disheartening when we consider
the economic and political power we wield
increasingly in world affairs.</p>

<p>It is a serious commentary upon the talent
of recent congresses that the House has developed
no men so commanding as to awaken
speculation as to their availability for the presidency.
No member of the House figured this
year in Republican presidential speculations.
Why do the second-rate predominate in a body
that may be called the most typical of our institutions?
Lincoln, Hayes, Garfield, Blaine,
McKinley, Bryan, all candidates for the presidency,
had been members of the House, but it
has become negligible as a training-school for
Presidents. A year ago Mr. Mann received an
occasional honorable mention, but his petulant
fling at the President as “playing politics,” in
the grave hour following the despatch of the
final note to Germany, effectually silenced his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
admirers. Admirable as partisanship may be,
there are times when even an opposition floor-leader
should be able to rise above it! Nor is it
possible for Democrats to point to Mr. Kitchin
with any degree of pride. Of both these men it
may be said that never have leaders failed so
lamentably to rise to their opportunities. Mr.
Hay, of Virginia, Chairman of the Committee
on Military Affairs, not only yielded reluctantly
to the public pressure for preparedness, but
established his unfitness to hold any office by
tacking on the army bill a “joker” designed
to create a place for a personal friend. Mr.
Wilson, like Mr. Cleveland, has found his congresses
unruly or wabbly or egregiously stupid,
manifesting astonishingly little regard for their
party principles or policies. The present majority
has been distinguished for nothing so
much as impotence and parochialism.</p>

<p>Without respect to party, the average representative’s
vision is no wider than his district,
and he ponders national affairs solely
from a selfish standpoint. Through long years
we have used him as an errand-boy, a pension
agent, a beggar at the national till. His time is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
spent in demonstrating to his constituency that
when “pork” is being served he is on hand
with Oliver Twist’s plate. The people of one
district, proud of their new post-office, or rejoicing
in the appearance of a government
contractor’s dredge in their creek, do not consider
that their devoted congressman, to insure
his own success, has been obliged to assist
other members in a like pursuit of spoils
and that the whole nation bears the burden.</p>

<p>The member who carries a map of his district
with him to Washington, and never broadens
his horizon, is a relic of simpler times. In
days like these we can ill afford to smile with
our old tolerance at the “plain man of the
people,” who is likely to be the cheapest kind of
demagogue. A frock coat and a kind heart are
not in themselves qualifications for a congressman.
Eccentricity, proudly vaunted, whimsicalities
of speech, lofty scorn of conventions, have
all been sadly overworked. Talent of the first
order is needed in Congress; it is no place for
men who can’t see and think straight.</p>

<p>The Senate preserves at least something of
its old competence, and the country respects,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
I think, the hard work recently performed by
it. While its average is low, it contains men—some
of them little in the public eye—who are
specialists in certain fields. There is, I believe,
a general feeling that, with our tremendous industrial
and commercial interests, the presence
in the upper house of a considerable number of
business men and of fewer lawyers would
make for a better balanced and more representative
body. A first-rate senator need not be
an orator. The other day, when Senator Taggart,
a new member, protested vigorously
against the latest river-and-harbor swindle the
country applauded. Refreshing, indeed, to
hear a new voice in those sacred precincts raised
against waste and plunder! Senator Oliver, of
Pennsylvania, a protectionist, of course, is
probably as well informed on the tariff as any
man in America. I give him the benefit of this
advertisement the more cheerfully as I do not
agree with his views; but his information is
entitled to all respect. The late David Turpie,
of Indiana, by nature a recluse, and one of the
most unassuming men who ever sat in the
Senate, was little known to the country at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
large. I once heard Mr. Roosevelt and Judge
Gray of Delaware engage in a most interesting
exchange of anecdotes illustrative of Mr. Turpie’s
wide range of information. He was a first-rate
man. There is room in the Senate for a
great variety of talent, and its efficiency is not
injured by the frequent injection of new blood.
What the country is impatient of in the upper
house is dead men who have little information
and no opinions of value on any subject. The
election of senators directly by the people will
have in November its first trial—another step
toward pure democracy. We shall soon be able
to judge whether the electorate, acting independently,
is more to be trusted than the
legislatures.</p>

<p>I should be sorry to apply any words of President
Wilson in a quarter where he did not intend
them, but a paragraph of his address to
the Washington correspondents (May 15) might
well be taken to heart by a number of gentlemen
occupying seats in the legislative branch
of the government.</p>

<p>“I have a profound intellectual contempt for
men who cannot see the signs of the times. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
have to deal with some men who know no more
of the modern processes of politics than if they
were living in the eighteenth century, and for
them I have a profound and comprehensive
intellectual contempt. They are blind; they
are hopelessly blind; and the worst of it is I
have to spend hours of my time talking to them
when I know before I start, quite as though I
had finished, that it is absolutely useless to
talk to them. I am talking <i>in vacuo</i>.”</p>

<p>There are, indisputably, limitations upon
the patience of a first-rate man engaged in the
trying occupation of attempting to communicate
a first-rate idea to a second-rate mind.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>In recent years our periodical literature has
devoted much space to discussions of problems
of efficiency. We have heard repeatedly of the
demand, not for two-thousand-dollar men, but
for ten, twenty, and fifty thousand dollar men,
in the great industries. The efficiency engineer
has sprung into being; in my own city several
hundred employees of an automobile company<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
are organized into a class, of which a professor
of psychology is the leader, the purpose being
the promotion of individual and corporate
efficiency. The first-rate man is in demand as
a buyer, a salesman, a foreman, a manager.
One of the largest corporations in America pays
its employees bonuses apportioned on a basis
of their value as demonstrated by actual performances
from month to month. The minutest
economies are a matter of daily study in every
manufacturing and commercial house; the hunt
for the first-rate man is unceasing. Executive
ability, a special genius for buying and selling,
need never go unrecognized. Recently a New
York bank spent months searching for a bond-seller
and finally chose an obscure young man
from a Western town who fell by chance under
the eye of a “scout” sent out to look for talent.
But this eager search for the first-rate man,
so marked in commerce and industry, only
rarely touches our politics. It is only in politics
that the second-rate man finds the broadest
field for the exercise of his talents.</p>

<p>A President is beset by many embarrassments
in the exercise of the appointing power.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
Our feudal system, by which senators and representatives
are the custodians of post-office,
district attorneyships, marshalships, and countless
other positions, does not make for the
recognition of the fit. While the power to appoint
is vested in the executive, his choice must
be approved by the senators or representatives.
As the system operates, it is not really the
President who appoints but the senators or
representatives, and the President is expected to
meet their wishes. To question their recommendations
is to arouse animosity, and where the fate
of important legislation hangs in the balance a
President is under strong temptation to accept
the recommendation of second-rate men in order
to keep the members of the law-making bodies
in good humor.</p>

<p>In the professions and industries, in commercial
houses, even on the farm, the second-rate
man is not wanted; but political jobs,
high and low, are everywhere open to him.
Everything but the public service is standardized;
politics alone puts a premium upon inferiority.
The greatest emphasis is laid upon
the word service in every field but government.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
The average American “wants what he wants
when he wants it,” and is proud of his ability
to get it. “If it isn’t right, we make it right,”
is a popular business slogan. Hotels whose indifferent
service wins the displeasure of the
travelling public are execrated and blacklisted.
On the other hand, I have listened for hours
to the laudation of good hotels, of the efficiency
of railroads, of automobile manufacturers who
“give good service.” We have a pride in these
things; we like to relate incidents of our successful
“kick” when the berth that we had
reserved by telegraph wasn’t forthcoming and
how we “took it up” with the railroad authorities,
and how quickly our wounded feelings
were poulticed. “I guess that won’t happen
again on <i>that</i> road!” we chortle. Conversely we
make our errands to a city hall or court-house
as few as possible, knowing that the “service,”
offered at the people’s expense is of a different
order, and public officials may not be
approached in that confident spirit with which
we carry our needs or complaints to the heads
of a private business.</p>

<p>Or, if some favor is to be asked, we brag<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
that we have seen “Jim” or “Bob” and that
he “fixed” it for us. It happens not infrequently
that we want something “fixed” from purely
selfish motives—something that should not be
“fixed”—and it gives us a pleasurable sense of
our “influence” to know that, as we have always
treated “Jim” or “Bob” all right, “Jim”
or “Bob” cheerfully assists us. We chuckle
over the ease with which he accomplished the
fixing where it would have been impossible for
us to effect it through a direct legitimate appeal.
Thus in hundreds of ways a boss, great
or small, is able to grant favors that cost him
nothing, thereby blurring the vision of those
he places under obligations to the means by
which he gains his power.</p>

<p>In municipal government the second and the
third rate man, on down to a point where differentiations
fade to the vanishing point, finds
his greatest hope and security. As first-rate
men are not available for the offices, they
fall naturally to the inferior, the incompetent,
or the corrupt. In few cities of a hundred thousand
population is a man of trained ability
and recognized fitness ever seriously considered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
for the mayoralty. Modern city government,
with the broad powers conferred upon mayors,
requires intelligence of the highest order. Usually
without experience in large affairs, and
crippled by a well-established tradition that
he must reward party workers and personal
friends, the incumbent surrounds himself with
second and third rate men, for whose blunders
the taxpayer meekly pays the bills.</p>

<p>The mayor’s office is hardly second to the
presidency in the variety of its perplexities.
A man of the best intentions will fail to satisfy
a whole community. There is in every city a
group of reformers who believe that a mayor
should be able to effect the moral regeneration
of the human race in one term of office. The
first-rate man is aware of this, and the knowledge
diminishes his anxiety to seek the place.
A common indictment against the capable man
who volunteers for municipal service is that
his ignorance of political methods would make
him “impractical” if he were elected. This
sentiment is expressed frequently—often by
large taxpayers. The insinuation is that a man
of character and ideals would be unable to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
deal with the powers that prey by indirection.
This is quite true: the fit man, the first-rate
man, who would undertake the office untrammelled
by political obligations, would not know
the “good fellows” who must be dealt with in
a spirit of leniency. This delicate duty is more
safely intrusted to one who brings a certain
sympathy to bear upon the task.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the merits of party government
in its national application, there is
no sound argument for its continuance in municipal
affairs. Its effect is to discourage utterly,
in most communities, any effort the first-rate
man may be absurd enough to make to win
enough of the franchises of his fellow citizens
to land him in the mayoralty. On one occasion
a Republican United States senator, speaking
for his party’s candidate for the mayoralty
at the last rally of a campaign in my own city,
declared that his party must win, as defeat
would have a discouraging effect on Republicans
elsewhere. A few years ago both parties chose,
in the Indianapolis primaries, mayoralty candidates
of conspicuous unfitness. The Republican
candidate was an auctioneer, whose ready<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
tongue and drolleries on the stump made him
the central figure in a highly picturesque campaign.
He was elected and the affairs of a
city of a quarter of a million people were cheerfully
turned over to him. Ignorant of the very
terminology in which municipal affairs are discussed,
he avoided embarrassment by remaining
away from his office as much as possible.
In the last year of his administration—if so
dignified a term may be applied to his incumbency—he
resigned, to avoid the responsibility
of dealing with disorders consequent upon a
serious strike, and took refuge on the vaudeville
stage. He was no more unfit on the day
he resigned than on the day of his nomination
or election—a fact of which the electorate had
ample knowledge. He was chosen merely because
he was a vote-getter. Republicans voted
for him to preserve their regularity.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>I am prolonging these comments on municipal
government for the reason that the city
as a political factor is of so great influence in
the State and nation, and because the domination
of the unfit in the smaller unit offers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
more tangible instances for study. The impediments
encountered by the fit who offer themselves
for public service are many, and often
ludicrous. Twice, in Indianapolis, men of the
best standing have yielded under pressure to
a demand that they offer themselves for the
Republican mayoralty nomination. Neither had
the slightest intention of using the mayoralty
as a stepping-stone to higher office; the
motives animating both were the highest. One
of them was quickly disposed of by the report
sent “down the line” that he had not been
as regular as he might be, and by this token
was an undesirable candidate. The other was
subjected to a crushing defeat in the primary.
There was nothing against him except
that he was unknown to the “boys in the
trenches.”</p>

<p>From the window by which I write I can
see the chimneys of the flourishing industry
conducted by the first of these gentlemen.
He has constantly shown his public spirit in
the most generous fashion; he is an admirable
citizen. I dare say there is not an incompetent
man or woman on his pay-roll. If he were out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
of employment and penniless to-morrow, scores
of responsible positions would be open to him.
But the public would not employ him; his own
party would not even permit its membership
to express its opinion of him; and had he gone
before the electorate he would in all likelihood
have been defeated by an invincible combination
of every element of incompetence and
venality in the city.</p>

<p>The other gentleman, who began life as a
bank clerk, made a success of a commercial
business, and is now president of one of the
largest banks in the State. Such men are ineligible
for municipal office; they are first-rate
men; the very fact that they are men of character
and ability who could be trusted to manage
public affairs as they conduct their private
business, removes them at once from consideration.</p>

<p>Such experiences as these are not calculated
to encourage the capable man, the first-rate
man, to attempt to gain a public position. In
fact, it is the business of political organizations
to make the defeat of such men as humiliating
as possible. They must be got rid of; they must
be taught better manners!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>The good nature with which we accept the
second-rate man in municipal office is one of
the most bewildering of all our political phenomena.
“Well, things have always been this
way, and I guess they always will be,” expresses
the average citizen’s feeling about the
matter. As he cannot, without much personal
discomfort, change the existing order, he finds
solace in the reflection that he couldn’t do
anything about it if he tried. The more intolerant
he is of second-rate employees in his
own business, the more supinely he views the
transfer of public business from one set of incompetents
to another.</p>

<p>To lift municipal government out of politics
in States where the party organizations never
shut up shop but are ceaselessly plotting and
planning to perfect their lines, is manifestly
no easy task, but it may be accomplished by
effective leadership where the people are sincerely
interested. And it is significant that the
present movement for an abandonment of the
old pernicious, costly system took rise from
the dire calamities that befell two cities—Galveston
and Dayton—which were suddenly
confronted with problems that it would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
been madness to intrust to incompetents. This
illustrates a point overlooked by that large
body of Americans who refuse to bring to their
politics the test of fitness that they enforce
in private business. The second-rate man may
successfully hide his errors in normal conditions,
but his faults and weaknesses become
glaringly apparent when any severe demands
are made upon him.</p>

<p>I can suggest no permanent solution of the
problem of municipal government that does
not embrace the training of men for its particular
duties. A development of the city-manager
plan, of nation-wide scope, fortified by
special courses of training in schools able to
give the dignity of a stable profession to
municipal administration may ultimately be
the remedy.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The debauchery of young men by the bosses
is a familiar phase of our politics and is most
potent in the game of checking the advance of
the fit and assuring domination by the unfit.
Several thousand young men leave college<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
every year with some hope of entering upon a
political career. By the time a young man is
graduated he has elected to follow the banner
of some party. If he lives in a city and shows
a disposition to be of practical service, he is
warmly welcomed into the fold of one of the
organizations. He quickly becomes aware that
only by the display of a servile obedience can
he expect to become <i>persona grata</i> to the party
powers. By the time he has passed through one
campaign as a trusted member of a machine, his
political illusions are well-nigh destroyed. His
childish belief that only the fit should be elevated
to positions of responsibility, that public office
is a public trust, is pretty well dissipated.
“Good” men, he finds, are good only by the
tests of partisanship as applied by the bosses.
To strike at a boss is <i>lésé majesté</i>, and invites
drastic punishment.</p>

<p>The purpose of the young men’s political
clubs everywhere is to infuse the young voter
with the spirit of blind obedience and subjection.
He is graciously permitted to serve on
club committees as a step toward more important
recognition as ward committeeman, or he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
is given a place of some sort at headquarters
during the campaign. There are dozens of ways
in which the willing young man may be of use.
His illusions rapidly vanish. He is flattered by
the attentions of the bosses, who pat him on
the back and assure him that they appreciate
his loyal devotion to the party. With the hope
of preferment before him it is essential that
he establish as quickly as possible a reputation
for “regularity.” If his wise elders note any
restiveness, any tendency toward independence,
they at once warn him that he must “play the
game straight,” and shut his eyes to the sins
of his party. Or if his counsellors sympathize
with his predicament they advise him that the
only way he can gain a position from which to
make his ideas effective is by winning the
favor of the bosses and building up a personal
following.</p>

<p>In a campaign preliminary to a local primary
in my city I appealed to a number of young
men of good antecedents and rather exceptional
education, to oppose a particular candidate.
One of them, on coming home from an
Eastern university, had introduced himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
to me in the name of a great educator who
was one of my particular admirations. In every
one of these cases I was politely rebuffed. They
said the gentleman whose ambitions annoyed
me was a “good fellow” and “all right”; they
couldn’t see that any good would come of antagonizing
him. And they were right. No good
did come of it so far as the result was concerned.</p>

<p>There are countless ways in which a young
lawyer finds his connection with a machine
helpful. A word in the right quarter brings him
a client—a saloonkeeper, perhaps, who is meeting
with resistance in his effort to secure a renewal
of his license; or petty criminal cases
before magistrates—easily arranged where the
machine controls the police. He cannot fail to be
impressed with the perfection of a system that
so smoothly wields power by indirection. The
mystery of it all and the potency of the names
of the high powers appeal to his imagination;
there is something of romance in it. A deputyship
in the office of the prosecuting attorney
leads on to a seat in the legislature, and he may
go to Congress if he is “good.” He is purchased
with a price, bought, and paid for; his status<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
is fixed; he is a second-rate man. And by every
such young man in America the ideal of democracy,
the hope of republican government, is
just so much weakened.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Government by the unfit, domination by the
inferior, is greatly assisted by a widely accepted
superstition that a second-rate man, finding himself
in a position of responsibility, is likely to
display undreamed of powers. The idea seems to
be that the electorate, by a kind of laying on of
hands, confers fitness where none has previously
existed. Unfortunately such miracles are not frequent
enough to form the basis of a political
philosophy. Recourse to the recall as a means of
getting rid of an undesirable office-holder strikes
me as only likely to increase the indifference,
the languor, with which we now perform our
political duties.</p>

<p>Contempt for the educated man, a preposterous
assumption that by the very fact of his
training he is unfitted for office, continues
prevalent in many minds. Conscious of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
disqualification, President Wilson finds amusement
at times in referring to himself as a schoolmaster;
much criticism of his administration
is based upon the melancholy fact that he is a
“professor,” a scholar, as though a lifelong student
of history and politics were disqualified,
by the very fact of his preparation, for exalted
office.</p>

<p>The direct primary, as a means of assisting
first-rate men to office, has not yet realized
what was hoped for it, and there is growing
scepticism as to its efficacy. It is one of our
marked national failings that we expect laws
and systems to work automatically. If the
first-rate man cherishes the delusion that he
need only offer himself to his fellow partisans
and they will delightedly spring to his support,
he is doomed to a sad awakening. Unless
he has taken the precaution to ask the organization’s
permission to put his name on
the ballot and is promised support, he must
perfect an organization of his own with which
to make his fight in the primary. He must
open headquarters from which to carry on his
operations, make speeches before as many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
citizens as can be assembled to hear him, enlist
and pay helpers, most of whom expect jobs in
case he is successful. He must drop money into
palms of whose existence he never dreamed,
the recipients of his bounty being frequently
“scouts” from his opponents’ camps. The
blackmailing of candidates by charitable organizations—and
churches are not without
shame in this particular—is only one of the
thousand annoyances. He is not likely to enjoy
immunity from newspaper attack. Months of
time and much money are required for a primary
campaign. I venture the assertion that many
hundreds of candidates for office in this year
of grace began their campaigns for election already
encumbered by debts incurred in winning
their nominations, which brought them
only half-way to the goal. Such a burden, with
all its connotations of curtailed liberty and
shackling obligations, may not be viewed with
equanimity. Instead of making office-holding
more attractive to the first-rate man, the direct
primary multiplies his discouragements.</p>

<p>The second-rate man, being willing to accept
office as a party, not a public, trust, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
to use it in every way possible for the strengthening
of party lines, has the first-rate man, who
has only his merits to justify his ambitions, at
a serious disadvantage. When an organization
(the term by which a machine prefers to be
called) finds that it is likely to meet with defeat
through public resentment of its excesses,
it will sometimes turn to a first-rate man. But
this is only in cases of sheer desperation. There
is nothing more amusing than the virtuous air
with which a machine will nominate a first-rate
man where there is no possible danger of
party success. He it is whom the bosses are
willing to sacrifice. The trick is turned ingeniously
to the bosses’ advantage, for defeat
in such instances proves to the truly loyal that
only the “regulars” can get anywhere.</p>

<p>A young friend of mine once persuaded me to
join him in “bucking” a primary for the election
of delegates to a State convention. I cheerfully
lent my assistance in this laudable enterprise,
the more readily when he confided to me
his intention of employing machine methods.
A young man of intelligence and humor, he had,
by means which I deplored but to which I contributed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
lured from the organization one of
its star performers. I speak of this without
shame, that the cynical may not complain that
I am in politics a high brow or dreamy lotus
eater. Our ally knew the game; he knew how to
collect and deliver votes by the most approved
machine methods. We watched him work with
the keenest satisfaction. He brought citizens in
great numbers to vote our “slate,” many of
them men who had never been in the ward
before. We gloated with satisfaction as the day
declined and our votes continued to pile up. Our
moral natures were in the balance; if we beat
the machine with machine methods we meant
never, never to be good again! It seemed indeed
that our investment in the skilled worker
could not fail of success. When the votes were
counted, oh, what a fall was there, my countrymen!
“Our man” had merely used our automobiles,
and I refrain from saying what other
munitions of war, to get out the vote of the
opposition! We had in other words, accomplished
our own defeat!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span></p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>The past year has been marked by the agitation
for military preparedness; civil preparedness
strikes me as being of equal importance.
If I am right—or only half right—in my assertion
that we are governed very largely by
second-rate men and that public business is
confided chiefly to the unfit, then here is a
matter that cannot be ignored by those who
look forward hopefully to the future of American
democracy. There are more dangers within
than without, and our tame acceptance of
incompetence in civil office would certainly
bring calamity if suffered in a military establishment.
The reluctance of first-rate men
to accept or seek office is more disquieting
than the slow enlistments in the army and
navy. Competence in the one would do much
to assure intelligent foresight and efficiency in
the other.</p>

<p>It is a disturbing thought that we, the people,
really care so little, and that we are so willing
to suffer government by the second-rate, only
murmuring despairingly when the unhappy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
results of our apathy bring us sharply face to
face with failure.</p>

<p>“The fatalism of the multitude,” commented
upon strikingly by Lord Bryce, has established
in us the superstition that a kindly providence
presides over our destinies and that “everything
will come out right in the end.” But government
by good luck is not a safe reliance
for a nation of a hundred millions. Nothing
in history supports a blind faith in numbers
or in the wisdom of majorities. America’s hope
lies in the multiplication of the fit—the saving
remnant of Isaiah’s prophecies and Plato’s
philosophy—a doctrine applied to America by
Matthew Arnold, who remains one of the
shrewdest and most penetrating of all our
critics. Mr. Arnold distrusted numbers and
had no confidence in majorities. He said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To be a voice outside the state, speaking to mankind or
to the future, perhaps shaking the actual state to pieces
in doing so, one man will suffice. But to reform the state
in order to save it, to preserve it by changing it, a body
of workers is needed as well as a leader—a considerable
body of workers, placed at many points, and operating in
many directions.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>These days, amid “the thunder of the captains,
and the shouting,” there must be many
thousands of Americans who are truly of the
saving remnant, who view public matters soberly
and hold as something very fine and
precious our heritage of democracy. These we
may suppose will witness the dawn of election
day with a lively apprehension of their august
responsibilities, and exercise their right of selection
sanely and wisely. “They only who
build upon ideas, build for eternity,” wrote
Emerson.</p>

<p>This nation was founded on ideas, and clearly
in the ideas of the fit, the earnest, the serious,
lies its hope for the future. To eliminate the
second-rate, to encourage the first-rate man
to undertake offices of responsibility and
power—such must be the immediate concern
and the urgent business of all who love America.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE LADY OF LANDOR LANE</h2>
</div>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">“TAKE your choice; I have bungalows
to burn,” said the architect.</p>

<p>He and his ally, the real-estate man,
had been unduly zealous in the planting of
bungalows in the new addition beyond the
college. About half of them remained unsold,
and purchasers were elusive. A promised extension
of the trolley-line had not materialized;
and half a dozen houses of the bungalow type,
scattered along a ridge through which streets
had been hacked in the most brutal fashion,
spoke for the sanguine temper of the projectors
of Sherwood Forest. The best thing about the
new streets was their names, which were a
testimony to the fastidious taste of a professor
in the college who had frequently thundered
in print against our ignoble American nomenclature.</p>

<p>It was hoped that Sherwood Forest would
prove particularly attractive to newly married<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
folk of cultivation, who spoke the same social
language. There must, therefore, be a Blackstone
Road, as a lure for struggling lawyers;
a Lister Avenue, to tickle the imagination of
young physicians; and Midas Lane, in which
the business man, sitting at his own hearth
side far from the jarring city, might dream of
golden harvests. To the young matron anxious
to keep in touch with art and literature, what
could have been more delightful than the
thought of receiving her mail in Emerson Road,
Longfellow Lane, Audubon Road, or any one
of a dozen similar highways (if indeed the new
streets might strictly be so called) almost within
sound of the college bell? The college was a
quarter of a mile away, and yet near enough
to shed its light upon this new colony that
had risen in a strip of forest primeval, which,
as the promoting company’s circulars more or
less accurately recited, was only thirty minutes
from lobsters and head lettuce.</p>

<p>This was all a year ago, just as August
haughtily relinquished the world to the sway
of September. I held the chair of applied sociology
in the college, and had taken a year off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
to write a number of articles for which I had
long been gathering material. It had occurred
to me that it would be worth while to write
a series of sociological studies in the form of
short stories. My plan was to cut small cross-sections
in the social strata of the adjoining
city, in the suburban village which embraced
the college, and in the adjacent farm region,
and attempt to portray, by a nice balancing
of realism and romance, the lives of the people
in the several groups I had been observing. I
had talked to an editor about it and he had
encouraged me to try my hand.</p>

<p>I felt enough confidence in the scheme to
risk a year’s leave, and I now settled down to
my writing zestfully. I had already submitted
three stories, which had been accepted in a
cordial spirit that proved highly stimulating
to further endeavor, and the first of the series,
called <i>The Lords of the Round House</i>—a sketch
of the domestic relationships and social conditions
of the people living near the railroad
shops—had been commented on favorably as
a fresh and novel view of an old subject. My
second study dealt with a settlement sustained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
by the canning industry, and under the title,
<i>Eros and the Peach Crop</i>, I had described the
labors and recreations of this community
honestly, and yet with a degree of humor.</p>

<p>As a bachelor professor I had been boarding
near the college with the widow of a minister;
but now that I was giving my time wholly to
writing I found this domicile intolerable. My
landlady, admirable woman though she was,
was altogether too prone to knock at my door
on trifling errands. When I had filled my note-book
with memoranda for a sketch dealing
with the boarding-house evil (it has lately appeared
as <i>Charging What the Onion Will Bear</i>),
I resolved to find lodgings elsewhere. And besides,
the assistant professor of natural sciences
occupied a room adjoining mine, and the visits
of strange <i>reptilia</i> to my quarters were far
from stimulating to literary labor.</p>

<p>I had long been immensely curious as to
those young and trusting souls who wed in
the twenties, establish homes, and, unterrified
by cruel laws enacted for the protection of
confiding creditors, buy homes on the instalment
plan, keep a cow, carry life insurance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
buy theatre tickets, maintain a baby, and fit
as snugly into the social structure as though
the world were made for them alone. In my
tramps about the city I had marked with professional
interest the appearance of great
colonies of bungalows which had risen within
a few years, and which spoke with an appealing
eloquence for an obstinate confidence in
the marriage tie. In my late afternoon excursions
through these sprightly suburban regions
I had gazed with the frankest admiration upon
wholly charming young persons stepping
blithely along new cement walks, equipped
with the neatest of card-cases, or bearing embroidered
bags of sewing; and maids in the
smartest of caps opened doors to them. Through
windows guarded by the whitest of draperies,
I had caught glimpses of our native forests as
transformed into the sturdiest of arts-and-crafts
furniture. Both flower and kitchen gardens
were squeezed into compact plots of earth;
a Gerald or a Geraldine cooed from a perambulator
at the gate of at least every other establishment;
and a “syndicate” man-of-all-work
moved serenely from furnace to furnace, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
lawn to lawn, as the season determined. On
Sundays I saw the young husbands hieing to
church, to a golf-links somewhere, to tennis
in some vacant lot, or aiding their girlish wives
in the cheerfulest fashion imaginable to spray
rose-bushes or to drive the irrepressible dandelion
from the lawn of its delight.</p>

<p>These phenomena interested me more than
I can say. My aim was not wholly sociological,
for not only did I wish in the spirit of strictest
scientific inquiry to understand just how all
this was possible, but the sentimental aspect
of it exercised a strange fascination upon me.
When I walked these new streets at night and
saw lamps lighted in dozens of cheery habitations,
with the lord and lady of the bungalow
reading or talking in greatest contentment;
or when their voices drifted out to me from
nasturtium-hung verandas on summer evenings,
I was in danger of ceasing to be a
philosopher and of going over bodily to the
sentimentalists. Then, the scientific spirit mastering,
I vulgarly haunted the doors of the
adjacent shops and communed with grocers’
boys and drug clerks, that I might gain data<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
upon which to base speculations touching this
species, this “group,” which presented so gallant
a front in a world where bills are payable
not later than the tenth of every calendar
month.</p>

<p>“You may have the brown bungalow in
Audubon Road, the gray one in Washington
Hedge, or the dark green one in Landor Lane.
Take any one you like; they all offer about
the same accommodations,” said the architect.
“You can put such rent as you see fit in the
nearest squirrel box, and if you meet an intending
purchaser with our prospectus in his
hand I expect you to take notice and tease
him to buy. We’ve always got another bungalow
somewhere, so you won’t be thrown in
the street.”</p>

<p>I chose Landor Lane for a variety of reasons.
There were as yet only three houses in the
street, and this assured a degree of peace. Many
fine forest trees stood in the vacant lots, and
a number had been suffered to remain within
the parking retained between sidewalk and
curb, mitigating greatly the harsh lines of the
new addition. But I think the deciding factor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
was the name of the little street. Landor had
always given me pleasure, and while it is possible
that a residence in Huxley Avenue might
have been more suitable for a seeker of truth,
there was the further reflection that truth,
touched with the iridescent glow of romance,
need suffer nothing from contact with the spirit
of Walter Savage Landor.</p>

<p>Directly opposite my green bungalow was
a dark brown one flung up rather high above
the lane. The promoters of the addition had
refrained from smoothing out the landscape,
so that the brown bungalow was about twenty
feet above the street, while my green one was
reached by only half a dozen steps.</p>

<p>On the day that I made my choice I saw
a child of three playing in the grass plot before
the brown bungalow. It was Saturday
afternoon, and the typical young freeholder
was doing something with an axe near the
woodshed, and even as I surveyed the scene
the domestic picture was completed by the
appearance of the inevitable young woman,
who came from the direction of the trolley-terminus,
carrying the usual neat card-case in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
her hand. Here was exactly what I wanted—a
chance to study at close hand the bungalow
type, and yet, Landor Lane was so quiet, its
trio of houses so distributed, that I might enjoy
that coveted detachment so essential to contemplative
observation and wise judgments.</p>

<p>“I’ve forgotten,” mused the architect, as
we viewed the scene together, “whether the
chap in that brown bungalow is Redmond, the
patent lawyer, or Manderson, the tile-grate
man. There’s a baby of about the same vintage
at both houses. If that isn’t Redmond over
there showing Gladstonian prowess with the
axe, it’s Manderson. Woman with child and
cart; number 58; West Gallery; artist unknown.”
It pleased my friend’s humor to quote
thus from imaginary catalogues. “Well, I don’t
know whether those are the Redmonds or the
Mandersons; but come to think of it, Redmond
isn’t a lawyer, but the inventor of a new office
system by which profit and loss are computed
hourly by a device so simple that any child
may operate it. A man of your cloistral habits
won’t care about the neighbors, but I hope
that chap isn’t Redmond. A man who will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
think up a machine like that isn’t one you’d
expose perfectly good garden hose to, on dark
summer nights.”</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>A Japanese boy who was working his way
through college offered to assume the responsibilities
of my housekeeping for his board.
Banzai brought to the task of cooking the deft
hand of his race. He undertook the purchase
of furniture to set me up in the bungalow, without
asking questions—in itself a great relief.
In a week’s time he announced that all was
in readiness for my transfer, so that I made
the change quite casually, without other impedimenta
than a portfolio and a suitcase.</p>

<p>On that first evening, as Banzai served my
supper—he was a past master of the omelet—I
enjoyed a peace my life had not known before.
In collecting material for my earlier
sketches I had undeniably experienced many
discomforts and annoyances; but here was an
adventure which could hardly fail to prove
pleasant and profitable.</p>

<p>As I loafed with my pipe after supper, I resolved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
to make the most of my good fortune
and perfect a study of the bungalow as an expression
of American civilization which should
be the final word on that enthralling subject. I
was myself, so to speak, a bungaloyd—the
owner or occupant of a bungalow—and while
I was precluded by my state of bachelorhood
from entering fully into the life which had so
aroused my curiosity, I was nevertheless confident
that I should be able to probe deeply and
sympathetically into the secret of the bungalow’s
happiness.</p>

<p>Having arranged my books and papers I
sought the open. Banzai had secured some
porch furniture of a rustic pattern, but he had
neglected to provide pillows, and as the chairs
of hickory boughs were uncomfortable, I
strolled out into the lane. As I stood in the
walk, the door of the brown bungalow opened
and a man came forth and descended to the
street. It was a clear night with an abundance
of stars, and the slim crescent of a young moon
hung in the west. My neighbor struck a match
and drew the flame into his pipe in four or five
deliberate inhalations. In the match-flare I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
saw his face, which impressed me as sombre,
though this may have been the effect of his
dark, close-trimmed beard. He stood immovable
for five minutes or more, then strolled
aimlessly away down the lane.</p>

<p>Looking up, I saw a green-shaded lamp
aglow in the front window of the bungalow,
and almost immediately the young wife opened
the door and came out hastily, anxiously. She
ran half-way down the steps, with the light
of the open door falling upon her, and after
a hurried glance to right and left called softly,
“Tom!”</p>

<p>“Tom,” she repeated more loudly; then she
ran back into the house and reappeared, flinging
a wrap over her shoulders, and walked
swiftly away in the direction taken by the
lord of the bungalow.</p>

<p>Could it be possible, I pondered, that the
happiness I had attributed to bungalow folk
was after all of such stuff as dreams are made
of? There had been almost a sob in that second
cry of “Tom!” and I resented it. The scene
was perfectly set; the green-shaded lamp had
been lighted, ready for that communing of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
two souls which had so deeply moved and interested
me as I had ranged the land of the
bungalow; yet here was a situation which rose
blackly in my imagination. I was surprised to
find how quickly I took sides in this unhappy
drama; I was all for the woman. The glimpse
I had caught of her, tripping homeward in
the lane, swinging her card-case, had been
wholly pleasing; and I recalled the joyous quick
rush with which she had clasped her child. I
was sure that Tom was a monster, eccentric,
selfish, indifferent. There had been a tiff, and
he had gone off to sulk in the dark like a wilful,
perverse child.</p>

<p>I was patrolling my veranda half an hour
later, when I heard steps and then voices on
the walk opposite, and back they came. It is
a woman’s way, I reflected, to make all the
advances; and this young wife had captured
the runaway and talked him into good humor.
A moment later they were seated beside the
table in the living-room, and so disposed that
the lamp did not obscure them from each other.
She was reading aloud, and occasionally glanced
up, whether to make sure of his attention or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
to comment upon the book I did not know;
and when it occurred to me that it was neither
dignified nor decent to watch my neighbors
through their window, I went indoors and
wrote several pages of notes for a chapter which
I now felt must be written, on “Bungalow
Shadows.”</p>

<p>Manderson was the name; Banzai made sure
of this at the grocer’s. As I took the air of the
lane the next morning before breakfast, I saw
that the Redmonds were a different sort. Redmond,
a big fellow, with a loud voice, was bidding
his wife and child good-by. The youngster
toddled after him, the wife ran after the child,
and there was much laughter. They all stopped
to inspect me, and Redmond introduced himself
and shook hands, with the baby clutching
his knees. He presented me to his wife, and
they cordially welcomed me to the lane to the
baby’s cooing accompaniment. They restored
me to confidence in the bungalow type; no
doubt of the Redmonds being the real thing!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span></p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>The lady of the brown bungalow was, however,
far more attractive than her sister of the
red one, and the Mandersons as a family were
far more appealing than the Redmonds. My
note-book filled with memoranda touching the
ways and manners of the Mandersons, and
most of these, I must confess, related to Mrs.
Manderson. She was exactly the type I sought,
the veritable <i>dea ex machina</i> of the bungalow
world. She lived a good deal on her veranda,
and as I had established a writing-table on
mine I was able to add constantly to my notes
by the mere lifting of my eyes. I excused
my impudence in watching her on scientific
grounds. She was no more to me than a new
bird to an ornithologist, or a strange plant to
a botanist.</p>

<p>Occasionally she would dart into the house
and attack an upright piano that stood by the
broad window of the living-room. I could see
the firm clean stroke of her arms as she played.
Those brilliant, flashing, golden things of
Chopin’s she did wonderfully; or again it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
be Schumann’s spirit she invoked. Once begun,
she would run on for an hour, and Banzai
would leave his kitchen and crouch on our
steps to listen. She appeared at times quite
fearlessly with a broom to sweep the walk,
and she seemed to find a childish delight in
sprinkling the lawn. Or she would set off, basket
in hand, for the grocer’s, and would return
bearing her own purchases and none the less
a lady for a’ that. There was about her an indefinable
freshness and crispness. I observed
with awe her succession of pink and blue shirt
waists, in which she caught and diffused the
sun like a figure in one of Benson’s pictures;
and when she danced off with her card-case
in a costume of solid white, and with a flappy
white hat, she was not less than adorable.</p>

<p>Manderson nodded to me the second day, a
little coldly, as we met in the walk; and thereafter
bowed or waved a hand when I fell under
his eye. One evening I heard him calling her
across the dusk of the yard. Her name was
Olive, and nothing, it seemed to me, was ever
more fitting than that.</p>

<p>One morning as I wrote at my table on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
veranda I was aroused by a commotion over
the way. The girl of all work appeared in the
front yard screaming and wringing her hands,
and I rushed across the lane to learn that the
water-heater was possessed of an evil spirit
and threatened to burst. The lady of the bungalow
had gone to town and the peril was imminent.
I reversed all the visible valves, in that
trustful experimental spirit which is the flower
of perfect ignorance, and the catastrophe was
averted. I returned to my work, became absorbed,
and was only aroused by a tug at my
smoking-jacket. Beside me stood the Manderson
baby, extending a handful of dahlias! Her
manner was of ambassadorial gravity. No
word was spoken, and she trotted off, laboriously
descended my steps, and toddled across
the lane.</p>

<p>Her mother waited at the curb, and as I
bowed in my best manner, holding up the
dahlias, she called, “Thank you!” in the most
entrancing of voices. Mr. James declares that
the way one person looks at another may be,
in effect, an incident; and how much more
may “Thank you,” flung across a quiet street,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
have the weight of hours of dialogue! Her voice
was precisely the voice that the loveliest of
feminine names connotes, suggesting Tennysonian
harmonies and cadences, and murmuring
waters of——</p>

<p class="center">“Sweet Catullus’s all-but-island, olive-silvery Sirmio.”</p>

<p>A bunch of dahlias was just the epistolary form
to which a bungalow lady would resort in communicating
with a gentleman she did not know.
The threatened explosion of the heater had
thus served to introduce me to my neighbor,
and had given me at the same time a new revelation
of her sense of the proprieties, her graciousness,
and charm. In my visit to the house
I had observed its appointments with a discreet
but interested eye, and I jotted down many notes
with her dahlias on the table before me. The
soft tints of the walls, the well-chosen American
rugs, the comfort that spoke in the furniture
reflected a consistent taste. There was
the usual den, with a long bench piled with
cushions, and near at hand a table where a
tray of smoker’s articles was hedged in with
magazines, and there were books neatly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
shelved, and others, lying about, testified to
familiar use. The upright piano, by the window
of my frequent contemplation, bore the
imprimatur of one of the most reputable
makers, and a tall rack beside it was filled with
music. Prone on the player’s seat lay a doll—a
fact I noted with satisfaction, as evidence
of the bungalow baby’s supremacy even where
its mother is a veritable reincarnation of St.
Cecilia.</p>

<p>The same evening Manderson came home
in haste and departed immediately with a
suitcase. I had hoped that he would follow
the dahlias in person to discuss the housemaid’s
embarrassments with the plumbing and bring
me within the arc of his domestic circle, but
such was not to be the way of it.</p>

<p>He was gone three days, and while the lady
of the bungalow now bowed to me once daily
across the lane, our acquaintance progressed
no further. Nor, I may add, did my work move
forward according to the schedule by which it
is my habit to write. I found myself scribbling
verses—a relaxation I had not indulged in
since my college days. I walked much, surveying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
the other streets in Sherwood Forest
Addition and gloomily comparing them with
Landor Lane to their disadvantage. I tramped
the shore of the little lake and saw her there
once and again, at play with the baby. She
and Mrs. Redmond exchanged visits frequently
with bungalow informality. One afternoon half
a dozen young women appeared for tea on the
deep veranda, and the lane was gay with
laughter. They were the ladies of the surrounding
bungalow district, and their party was the
merriest. I wondered whether she had waited
for a day when her husband was absent to
summon these sisters. It was a gloomy fate
that had mated her with a melancholy soul like
Manderson.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>I had written several couplets imploring the
protection of the gods for the Lady of the Lane,
and these I had sketched upon a large sheet
of cardboard the better to scrutinize them.
And thereby hangs the saddest of revelations.
My friend the architect had sent me a number
of advertisements with a request that I should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
persuade Banzai to attach them to the adjacent
landscape. Returning from a tramp I
beheld Olive (as I shall not scruple to call her)
studying a placard on a telephone-post in the
lane a little beyond her bungalow. It struck
me as odd that she should be so interested in
a mere advertisement of bungalows, when she
was already cosily domiciled in the prettiest
one the addition boasted. She laughed aloud,
then turned guardedly, saw me, and marched
demurely home without so much as glancing
a second time in my direction.</p>

<p>After she had tripped up the steps and
vanished I saw the grievous thing that Banzai
had done. By some inadvertence he had thrust
the card bearing my verses among the advertisements,
and with all the posts and poles and
tree-boxes in Christendom to choose from, he
had with unconscious malevolence nailed my
couplets to the telephone-pole nearest the Manderson
bungalow. It was an unpardonable
atrocity, the enormity of which I shall not
extenuate by suppressing the verses:</p>

<p>It was bad enough to apostrophize my
neighbor’s wife in song; but to publish my
infamy to the world was an even more grievous
sin. I tore the thing down, bore it home, and
thrust it into the kitchen range before the eyes
of the contrite Banzai. Across the way Olive
played, and I thought there was mockery in
her playing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>Realism is, after all, on much better terms
with Romance than the critics would have us
believe. If Manderson had not thawed sufficiently
to borrow the realistic monkey-wrench
which Banzai used on our lawn-mower, and if
Olive had not romantically returned it a week
later with a card on which she had scribbled
“Many apologies for the long delay,” I might
never have discovered that she was not in fact
Manderson’s wife but his sister. Hers was the
neatest, the best-bred of cards, and bore the
name incontrovertibly——</p>

<p>I throw this to the realists that they may
chortle over it in the way of their grim fraternity.
Were I cursed with the least taint of
romanticism I should not disclose her maiden
state at this point, but hold it for stirring dramatic
use at the moment when, believing her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
to be the wife of the mournful tile-grate
man, I should bid her good-by and vanish forever.</p>

<p>The moment that card reached me by the
hand of her housemaid she was playing a
Chopin polonaise, and I was across the lane
and reverently waiting at the door when the
last chord sounded. It was late on an afternoon
at the threshold of October, but not too
cool for tea <i>al fresco</i>. When the wind blew chill
from the lake she disappeared, and returned
with her hands thrust into the pockets of a
white sweater.</p>

<p>It was amazing how well we got on from
the first. She explained herself in the fewest
words. Her brother’s wife had died two years
before, and she had helped to establish a home
for him in the hope of mitigating his loneliness.
She spoke of him and the child with the tenderest
consideration. He had been badly broken
by his wife’s death, and was given to brooding.
I accused myself bitterly for having so grossly
misjudged him as to think him capable of harshness
toward the fair lady of his bungalow. He
came while I still sat there and greeted me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
amiably, and when I left we were established
on the most neighborly footing.</p>

<p>Thenceforth my work prospered. Olive revealed,
with the nicest appreciation and understanding
of my needs, the joys and sorrows
of suburban bungalowhood. The deficiencies
of the trolley service, the uncertainties of the
grocer’s delivery she described in the aptest
phrases, her buoyant spirit making light of all
such vexations.</p>

<p>The manifold resources and subterfuges of
bungalow housekeeping were unfolded with
the drollest humor. The eternal procession of
cooks, the lapses of the neighborhood hired man,
the fitfulness of the electric light—all such
tragedies were illuminated with her cheery
philosophy. The magazine article that I had
planned expanded into a discerning study of
the secret which had baffled and lured me, as to
the flowering of the bungalow upon the rough
edges of the urban world. The aspirations expressed
by the upright piano, the perambulator,
the new book on the arts-and-crafts table, the
card-case borne through innumerable quiet lanes—all
such phenomena Olive elucidated for my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
instruction. The shrewd economies that explained
the occasional theatre tickets; the incubator
that robbed the grocer to pay the
milliner; the home-plied needle that accounted
for the succession of crisp shirt waists—into
these and many other mysteries Olive initiated
me.</p>

<p>Sherwood Forest suddenly began to boom,
and houses were in demand. My architect friend
threatened me with eviction, and to avert the
calamity I signed a contract of purchase, which
bound me and my heirs and assigns forever to
certain weekly payments; and, blithe opportunist
that I am, I based a chapter on this
circumstance, with the caption “Five Dollars
a Month for Life.” I wrote from notes supplied
by Olive a dissertation on “The Pursuit of the
Lemon”—suggested by an adventure of her
own in search of the fruit of the <i>citrus limonum</i>
for use in garnishing a plate of canned salmon
for Sunday evening tea.</p>

<p>Inspired by the tender, wistful autumn days
I wrote verses laboriously, and boldly hung
them in the lane in the hope of arresting my
Rosalind’s eye. One of these (tacked to a tree<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
in a path by the lake) I here insert to illustrate
the plight to which she had brought me:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div></div>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Olive suffered my rhyming with the same
composure with which she met the unpreluded
passing of a maid of all work, or the ill-natured
smoking of the furnace on the first day it was
fired. She preferred philosophy to poetry, and
borrowed Nietzsche from the branch library.
She persuaded me that the ladies of the bungalows
are all practical persons, and so far as I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
am concerned, Olive fixed the type. It had
seemed to me, as I viewed her comings and
goings at long range, that she commanded
infinite leisure; and yet her hours were crowded
with activities. I learned from her that cooks
with diplomas are beyond the purses of most
bungalow housekeepers; and as Olive’s brother’s
digestive apparatus was most delicate she assumed
the responsibility of composing cakes
and pastries for his pleasure. With tea (and
we indulged in much teaing) she gave me
golden sponge-cake of her own making which
could not have failed to delight the severest
Olympian critic. Her sand tarts established a
new standard for that most delectable item of
the cook-book. She ironed with her own hands
the baby’s more fragile frocks. Nor did such
manual employments interfere in any way
whatever with the delicacy of her touch upon
the piano. She confided to me that she made
a practice of reviewing French verbs at the
ironing-board with a grammar propped before
her. She belonged to a club which was studying
Carlyle’s <i>French Revolution</i>, and she was secretary
of a musical society—formed exclusively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
of the mistresses of bungalows, who had nobly
resolved to devote the winter to the study of
the works of John Sebastian Bach.</p>

<p>It gradually became clear that the romance
of the American bungalow was reinforced and
strengthened by a realism that was in itself
romance, and I was immensely stimulated by
this discovery. It was refreshing to find that
there are, after all, no irreconcilable differences
between a pie well made and a Chopin polonaise
well played. Those who must quibble over the
point may file a demurrer, if they so please,
with the baby asleep in the perambulator on
the nearest bungalow veranda, and the child,
awaking, will overrule it with a puckered face
and a cry that brings mama on the run with
Carlyle in her hand.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Olive was twenty-five. Twenty-five is the
standard age, so to speak, of bungalow matrons.
My closest scrutiny has failed to discover one
a day older. It is too early for any one to forecast
the ultimate fate of the bungalow. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
bungalow speaks for youth, and whether it will
survive as an architectural type, or whether
those hopeful young married persons who trustingly
kindle their domestic altars in bungalow
fireplaces will be found there in contentment at
fifty, is not for this writing. What did strike
me was the fact that Olive, being twenty-five,
was an anomaly as a bungalow lady by reason
of her unmarriedness. Her domesticity was
complete, her efficiency indisputable, her charm
ineffable; and it seemed that here was a chance
to perfect a type which I, with my strong scientific
bent, could not suffer to pass. By the mere
process of changing the name on her visiting
card, and moving from a brown to a green bungalow,
she might become the perfect representation
of the most interesting and delightful
type of American women. Half of my study
of bungalow life was finished, and a publisher
to whom I submitted the early chapters returned
them immediately with a contract,
whose terms were in all ways generous, so
that I was able to view the future in that
jaunty confidence with which young folk
intrust their fate to the bungalow gods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>I looked up from my writing-table, which
the chill air had driven indoors, and saw Olive
on her lawn engaged in some mysterious occupation.
She was whistling the while she
dabbed paint with a brush and a sophisticated
air upon the bruised legs of the baby’s high
chair.</p>

<p>At my approach Romance nudged Realism.
Or maybe it was Realism that nudged Romance.
I cannot see that it makes the slightest difference,
one way or another, on whose initiative
I spoke: let it suffice that I did speak. Realism
and Romance tripped away and left me alone
with the situation. When I had spoken Olive
rose, viewed her work musingly, with head
slightly tilted, and still whistling touched the
foot-rest of the baby chair lingeringly with the
paint-brush. Those neat cans of prepared paint
which place the most fascinating of joys within
the range of womankind are in every well-regulated
bungalow tool-closet—and another
chapter for my book began working in my
subconsciousness.</p>

<p>A little later Romance and Realism returned
and stood to right and left of us by the living-room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
fire. Realism, in the outward form of
W. D. H., winked at Romance as represented
by R. L. S. I observed that W. D. H., in a
pepper-and-salt business suit, played with his
eye-glasses; R. L. S., in a velvet jacket, toyed
with his dagger hilt.</p>

<p>Olive informed me that her atrabilious
brother was about to marry a widow in Emerson
Road, so there seemed to be no serious
obstacle to the immediate perfecting of Olive
as a type by a visit to the young clergyman
in the white bungalow in Channing Lane, on
the other side of Sherwood Forest Addition.
Romance and Realism therefore quietly withdrew
and left us to discuss the future.</p>

<p>“I think,” said Olive with a far-away look
in her eyes, “that there should be a box of
geraniums on our veranda rail next summer,
and that a hen-house could be built back of
the coal shed without spoiling the looks of the
yard.”</p>

<p>As I saw no objection whatever to these
arrangements, we took the baby for a walk,
met Tom at the car, and later we all dined
together at the brown bungalow. I seem to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
recall that there was roast fowl for dinner, a
salad with the smoothest of mayonnaise, canned
apricots, and chocolate layer cake, and a Schumann
programme afterward.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">HOW, THEN, SHOULD SMITH VOTE?</h2>

<p class="ph1">[1920]</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE talk on the veranda had been prolonged,
and only my old friend Smith,
smoking in meditative silence, had refused
to contribute to our discussion of the
men and the issues. Between campaigns Smith
is open-minded on all matters affecting the
body politic. Not infrequently his views are
marked by a praiseworthy independence. Smith
has brains; Smith thinks. A Republican, he
criticises his party with the utmost freedom;
and when sorely tried he renounces it with a
superb gesture of disdain. But on election day,
in a mood of high consecration, he unfailingly
casts his ballot for the Republican nominee.
A week earlier he may have declared in the
most convincing manner that he would not
support the ticket; and under extreme provocation
I have known him to threaten to leave
the Republican fold for all time.</p>

<p>Party loyalty is one of the most powerful
factors in the operation of our democracy, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
it has its special psychology, to which only a
Josiah Royce could do full justice. Smith really
thinks that he will bolt; but when it comes to
the scratch an influence against which he is
powerless stays his hand when he is alone in
the voting booth with his conscience and his
God. Later, when gently reminded of this mood
of disaffection, he snarls that, when it comes
down to brass tacks, any Republican is better
than any Democrat, anyhow—a fragment of
philosophy that is the consolation of great
numbers of Smiths.</p>

<p>Smith, as I was saying, had refrained from
participating in our talk on that August night
where the saltless sea complained upon the
beach and the pines took counsel of the stars.
Then, as the party broke up, Smith flung his
cigar into Lake Michigan and closed the discussion
by remarking with a despairing sigh—</p>

<p>“Well, either way, the people lose!”</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Smith prides himself on his ability to get
what he wants when he wants it—in everything
but politics. In all else that pertains to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
his welfare Smith is informed, capable, and
efficient. In his own affairs he tells the other
fellow where to get off, and if told he can’t do
a thing he proceeds at once to do it and to do it
well. It is only in politics that his efforts are
futile and he takes what is “handed him.”
Under strong provocation he will, in the manner
of a dog in the highway, run barking after
some vehicle that awakens his ire; but finding
himself unequal to the race, he meekly trots
back to his own front yard. If the steam roller
runs over him and the self-respect is all but
mashed out of him, he picks himself up and
retires to consider it yet again. He has learned
nothing, except that by interposing himself
before a machine of superior size and weight
he is very likely to get hurt; and this he knew
before.</p>

<p>Smith and I are in the north woods thirty-five
miles from a telegraph instrument, where
it is possible to ponder great questions with a
degree of detachment. Loafing with Smith is
one of the most profitable things I do; he is
the best of fellows, and, as our lives have run
parallel from school-days with an unbroken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
intimacy, we are thoroughly familiar with each
other’s manner of thought. What I am setting
down here is really a condensed report of our
talks. Just where Smith leaves off and I begin
doesn’t matter, for we speak the same language
of the Ancient Brotherhood of the Average
Man. Smith is a Republican; I am a Democrat.
We have “gone to the mat” in many campaigns,
each valiantly defending his party and its
heroes. But, chumming together in August,
1920, the punch had gone out of us. We talked
of men and issues, but not with our old fervor.
At first we were both shy of present-day matters,
and disposed to “sidle up” to the immediate
situation—to reach it by reluctant, tangential
approaches, as though we were strangers,
wary of wounding each other’s feelings.</p>

<p>We mean to keep smiling about this whole
business. We Americans seem destined to rock
dizzily on the brink of many precipices without
ever quite toppling over. We have lived through
wars and rumors of wars, and have escaped
pestilence and famine, and we are deeply grateful
that the present campaign lays so light a
tax upon the emotions. The republic isn’t going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
to perish, no matter who’s elected. One
thing is certain, however, and that is that this
time we—that is, Smith and I—are not going
to be jostled or pushed.</p>

<p>The other day we interviewed an Indian—whether
untaxed or enrolled at the receipt of
custom we didn’t ascertain. Smith asked him
whether he was for Cox or Harding, and the
rightful heir to all the territory in sight, interpreting
our courteous inquiry in a restricted
tribal rather than a national spirit replied,
“No whisk.” He thought we were deputy
sheriffs looking for boot-leggers. Even at that,
Smith held “no whisk” to be the most intelligent
answer he had as yet received to his
question.</p>

<p>Smith nearly upset the canoe one morning
as he turned suddenly to demand fiercely:
“What’s this campaign all about anyhow?”
This was a dismaying question, but it precipitated
a fortnight of reminiscences of the
changing fortunes of parties and of battles long
ago, with the usual profitless palaver as to
whether the giants of other days were really
bigger and nobler than those of the present.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
We decided, of course, that they were, having
arrived at that time of life when pygmies loom
large in the twilight shades of vanishing perspectives.
The recuperative power of parties
kept us interested through several evenings.
It seemed a miracle that the Democratic party
survived the Civil War. We talked much of
Cleveland, speaking of him wistfully, as the
habit now is—of his courage and bluff honesty.</p>

<p>In generous mood we agreed that Mr. Bryan
had at times rendered meritorious service to
his country, and that it was a good thing to
encourage such evangelists occasionally to give
the kettle a vigorous stirring up. The brilliant
qualities as well as the many irritating characteristics
of Colonel Roosevelt were dwelt
upon, and we readily and amiably concluded
that many pages of American history would
be dull without him. He knew what America
is all about, and that is something. We lamented
the disheartening circumstance that in the
very nature of our system of political management
there must always be men of first-rate
capacity who can never hope to win the highest
place—men, for example, of indubitable wisdom,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
character, and genius, like George F.
Edmunds, Elihu Root, and Judge Gray of
Delaware.</p>

<p>“When I’ve got a place to fill in my business,”
said Smith, “I pick out a man I’m dead
sure can handle it; I can’t afford to experiment
with fakers and amateurs. But when it comes
to choosing a mayor in my town or a President
of the United States, I’ve got to take what I
can get.”</p>

<p>There is no justification for the party system,
unless the major parties are alert and
honest in criticism and exercise a restraining
influence upon each other. It is perfectly legitimate
for the opposition to pick out all the
weak spots in the record of an administration
and make the most of them. The rules of good
sportsmanship do not, unfortunately, apply in
politics. With all our insistence as a nation
upon fair play, we don’t practise our greatest
game in that spirit. It was not, I should say,
until after Mr. Cleveland’s second election
that the Civil War ceased to color political
discussion. Until I was well on toward manhood,
I was troubled not a little by a fear that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
the South would renew the war, so continually
was the great struggle of the sixties brought
fearsomely to the attention, even in local contests.
In the criticism that has been heaped
upon Mr. Wilson’s administration we have
been reminded frequently that he has been far
too responsive to Southern influence.</p>

<p>The violence of our partisanship is responsible
for the intrusion of all manner of extraneous
matters into campaigns. It would
seem that some single striking issue that
touches the pocketbook, like the tariff or silver,
is necessary, if the electorate is to be thoroughly
aroused. Human nature in a democracy is
quite what it is under any other form of government,
and is thoroughly disposed to view
all matters selfishly. Shantung and Fiume are
too remote to interest the great number of us
whose club is the corner grocery. Anything
beyond Main Street is alien to our interest.
We’ll buy food for the starving in other lands,
but that’s missionary work, not politics. Politics
is electing our township ticket, even though
Bill Jones does beat his wife and is bound to
make a poor constable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>We became slightly cynical at times, in the
way of Americans who talk politics heart-to-heart.
The national convention, where there is
a thrill in the sonority of the very names of
the far-flung commonwealths as they are recited
on roll-call, is, on the face of it, a glorious
expression of democracy at work. But in actual
operation every one knows that a national
convention is only nominally representative.
The delegates in their appointed places are not
free and independent American citizens, assembled,
as we would believe, to exercise their
best judgment as trustees of the “folks back
home.” Most of them owe their seats to the
favor of a district or State boss; from the moment
the convention opens they are the playthings
of the super-bosses, who plan in advance
every step in the proceedings.</p>

<p>Occasionally there are slips: the ringmaster
cracks his whip, confident that the show will
proceed according to programme, only to be
embarrassed by some irresponsible performer
who refuses to “take” the hoops and hurdles
in the prescribed order. In other terms, some
absurd person may throw a wrench into a perfectly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
functioning machine and change the
pattern it has been set to weave. Such sabotage
calls for a high degree of temerariousness, and
cannot be recommended to ambitious young
patriots anxious to ingratiate themselves with
the powers that control. At Baltimore, in 1912,
Mr. Bryan did the trick—the most creditable
act of his career; but in accepting for his reward
the premiership for which he was so conspicuously
unfit he foolishly spoiled his record and
promptly fulfilled the worst predictions of his
enemies.</p>

<p>There is an oft-quoted saying that the Democratic
party always may be relied upon to do
the wrong thing. Dating from 1876, when it so
nearly won the presidency, it has certainly been
the victim of a great deal of bad luck. However,
remembering the blasting of many Republican
hopes and the swift passing of many
Republican idols—the catastrophe that befell
the much-enduring Blaine, Mr. Taft’s melancholy
adventures with the presidency, the
Progressive schism, and the manner in which
Mr. Hughes struck out with the bases full—it
may hardly be said that the gods of good-fortune<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
have been markedly faithful to the Republicans.
Disappointments are inevitable; but
even the Grant third-termers and the followers
of the Plumed Knight and the loyal Bryan
phalanx outlived their sorrows. The supporters
of McAdoo and Palmer, of Wood and Lowden,
appear to be comfortably seated on the bandwagon.</p>

<p>Smith was an ardent supporter of General
Wood’s candidacy, and we sat together in the
gallery of the convention hall at Chicago and
observed with awe and admiration the manner
in which the general received the lethal thrust.
The noisy demonstrations, the oratory, the
vociferous whoops of the galleries touched us
not at all, for we are not without our sophistication
in such exhibitions. We listened with pleasure
to the impromptus of those stanch veterans
of many battles, Messrs. Depew and Cannon.
At other times, during lulls that invited oratory,
we heard insistent calls for Mr. Beveridge; but
these did not reach the ear, or failed to touch
the heart, of the chairman. The former senator
from Indiana had been a Progressive, and was
not to be trusted before a convention that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
might, with a little stimulation, have trampled
the senatorial programme under foot.</p>

<p>We knew before the opening prayer was
uttered that, when the delegates chose a candidate,
it would be only a <i>pro forma</i> confirmation
of a selection made privately by half a dozen
men, devout exponents of that principle of
party management which holds that the wisdom
of the few is superior to the silly clamor
of the many. At that strategic moment when
it became hazardous to indulge the deadlock
further, and expediency called for an adjournment
that the scene might be set for the last
act, the great lords quite shamelessly consulted
in full view of the spectators. Messrs. Lodge,
Smoot, Watson, and Crane, hastily reinforced
by Mr. Herrick, who, aware that the spotlight
was soon to be turned upon Ohio, ran nimbly
across the reporters’ seats to join the conference,
stood there in their majesty, like complacent
Olympians preparing to confer a boon
upon mankind. It was a pretty bit of drama.
The curtain fell, as upon a second act where
the developments of the third are fully anticipated
and interest is buoyed up only through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
the intermission by a mild curiosity as to the
manner in which the plot will be worked out.</p>

<p>My heart warmed to the enterprising reporter
who attached himself to the sacred group
for a magnificent moment. His forcible ejection
only emphasized the tensity of the situation
and brought into clearer relief the august figures
of the pontiffs, who naturally resented so gross
an intrusion upon their privacy.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The other night, when every prospect divulged
by the moon’s soft radiance was pleasing
and only the thought of man’s clumsy handiwork
was vile, Smith shocked me by remarking:</p>

<p>“This patter of both parties about the dear
people makes me sick. That vox populi vox
Dei stuff was always a fake. We think we’re
hearing an echo from heaven when it’s only
a few bosses in the back room of a hotel somewhere
telling us what we ought to want.” We
descanted upon this at length, and he adduced
much evidence in support of his contention.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
“What we’ve got in this country,” he snorted,
when I tried to reason him out of his impious
attitude, “is government of the people by the
bosses—for the bosses’ good. The people are
like a flock of silly sheep fattening for the wolf,
and too stupid to lift their eyes from the grass
to see him galloping down the hill. They’ve
got to be driven to the hole in the wall and
pushed through!”</p>

<p>He was mightily pleased when I told him
he had been anticipated by many eminent authorities
running back to Isaiah and Plato.</p>

<p>“Saving remnant” was a phrase to his liking,
and he kept turning it over and investing it
with modern meanings. Before we blew out the
candles we were in accord on the proposition
that while we have government by parties the
parties have got to be run by some one; what
is everybody’s business being, very truly, nobody’s
business. Hence the development of
party organizations and their domination by
groups, with the groups themselves deriving inspiration
usually from a single head. Under the
soothing influence of these bromides Smith
fell to sleep denouncing the direct primary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>“Instead of giving the power to the people,”
he muttered drowsily, “the bloomin’ thing
has commercialized office-seeking. We’re selling
nominations to the highest bidder. If I were
ass enough to chase a United States senatorship,
I wouldn’t waste any time on the people
until I’d been underwritten by a few strong
banks. And if I won, I’d be like the Dutchman
who said he was getting along all right, only he
was worried because he had to die and go to
hell yet. It would be my luck to be pinched as
a common felon, and to have my toga changed
for a prison suit at Leavenworth.”</p>

<p>Some candidate for the doctorate, hard put
for a subject, might find it profitable to produce
a thesis on American political phraseology.
As a people we are much addicted to felicitous
combinations of words that express large ideas
in the smallest possible compass. Not only does
political wisdom lend itself well to condensation,
but the silliest fallacy will carry far if
knocked into a fetching phrase. How rich in
its connotations even to-day is the old slogan,
“Tippecanoe and Tyler too”! and many others
equally illuminative of a period might be dug<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
out of the records from the beginning of our
history, including “the tariff is a tax,” “the
full dinner-pail,” down to “he kept us out of
war.” A telling phrase or a catchword is
enormously persuasive and convincing—the
shrewdest possible advertisement.</p>

<p>There is no way of knowing how many of
our hundred millions ever read a national platform,
but I will hazard the guess that not more
than twenty-five per cent have perused the
platforms of 1920 or will do so before election
day. The average voter is content to accept
the interpretations and laudatory comment of
his party paper, with its assurance that the
declaration of principles and purposes is in
keeping with the great traditions of the grand
old party. It is straining Smith’s patriotism
pretty far to ask him to read a solid page of
small type, particularly when he knows that
much of it is untrue and most of it sheer bunk.
Editorial writers and campaign orators read
platforms perforce; but to Smith they are
fatiguing to the eye and a weariness to the
spirit. The primary qualification for membership
on a platform committee is an utter lack—there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
must be no question about it—of a
sense of humor. The League of Nations plank
of the Republican platform is a refutation of
the fallacy that we are a people singularly
blessed with humor. We could ask no more
striking proof of the hypnotic power of a party
name than the acceptance of this plank, solemnly
sawed, trimmed, and painted red, white,
and blue, in the committee-room, and received
by the delegates with joyous acclamation.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>The embarrassments of the partisan who is
challenged to explain the faith that is in him
are greatly multiplied in this year of grace.
Considerable literature is available as to the
rise and development of the two major parties,
but a student might exhaust the whole of
it and yet read the Chicago and San Francisco
platforms as through a glass darkly. There is
a good deal of Jeffersonian democracy that is
extremely difficult to reconcile with many acts
of Mr. Wilson. The partisan who tries to square
his Democracy or his Republicanism with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
faith he inherited from his grandfather is
doomed to a severe headache. The rope that
separates the elephant from the donkey in
the menagerie marks only a nominal difference
in species: they eat the same fodder and, when
the spectator’s back is turned, slyly wink at
each other. There is a fine ring to the phrase
“a loyal Republican” or “a loyal Democrat,”
but we have reached a point of convergence
where loyalty is largely a matter of tradition
and superstition. What Jefferson said on a
given point, or what Hamilton thought about
something else, avails little to a Democrat or
a Republican in these changed times. We talk
blithely of fundamental principles, but are
still without the power to visualize the leaders
of the past in newly developed situations of
which they never dreamed. To attempt to
interview Washington as to whether he intended
his warning against entangling alliances
to apply to a League of Nations to insure the
peace of the world is ridiculous; as well invoke
Julius Cæsar’s opinion of present-day questions
of Italian politics.</p>

<p>Delightful and inspiring as it would doubtless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
be, we can’t quite trust the government
to the counsels of the ouija-board. The seats
of the cabinet or of the supreme bench will
hardly be filled with table-rapping experts
until more of us are satisfied of the authenticity
of the communications that purport to be postmarked
oblivion. We quote the great spirits
of the past only when we need them to give
weight and dignity to our own views. (Incidentally,
a ouija-board opinion from John
Marshall as to the propriety of tacking a police
regulation like the Eighteenth Amendment to
the Federal Constitution would be first-page
stuff for the newspapers.)</p>

<p>Monroe was luckier than most of our patriarchs.
The doctrine associated with his name
is jealously treasured by many patriotic Americans
who haven’t the slightest idea of the
circumstances that called it forth; but to mention
it in a discussion of international affairs
is to stamp the speaker as a person of breeding,
endowed with intellectual gifts of the highest
order. If by some post-mortem referendum we
could “call up” Monroe to explain just how
far America might safely go in the defense of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
his doctrine, and whether it could be advantageously
extended beyond the baths of all
the western stars to keep pace with such an
expansion as that represented by the Philippines,
we might profit by his answer—and
again, we might not.</p>

<p>We can’t shirk our responsibilities. One generation
can’t do the work of another. In the
last analysis we’ve got to stand on our own feet
and do our own thinking. The Constitution
itself has to be interpreted over and over again,
and even amended occasionally; for the world
does, in spite of all efforts to stop it, continue
to move right along. This is not a year in which
either of the major parties can safely harp upon
its “traditional policy.” There are skeletons in
both closets that would run like frightened
rabbits if dragged into the light and ordered
to solve the riddles of 1920.</p>

<p>The critics of President Wilson have dwelt
much on the vision of the founders, without
conceding that he too may be blessed with a
seer’s vision and the tongue of prophecy. To
his weaknesses as a leader I shall revert later;
but his high-mindedness and earnest desire to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
serve the nation and the world are questioned
only by the most buckramed hostile partisan,
or by those who view the present only through
the eyes of dead men.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>When President Wilson read his war message
to the Congress it must have been in the minds
of many thousands who thrilled to the news
that night, that a trinity of great American
presidents was about to be completed; that a
niche awaited Mr. Wilson in the same alcove
with Washington and Lincoln. Many who
were impatient and restless under the long
correspondence with the Imperial German
Government were willing to acknowledge that
the delay was justified; that at last the nation
was solidly behind the administration; that
amid the stirring call of trumpets partisanship
would be forgotten; and that, when the world
was made safe for law and decency, Mr. Wilson
would find himself in the enjoyment of an unparalleled
popularity. It did not seem possible
that he could fail. That he did fail of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
hopes and expectations is not a matter that
any true lover of America can contemplate
with jubilation. Those of us who ask the greatest
and the best things of and for America can
hardly be gratified by any failure that might
be construed as a sign of weakness in democracy.
But Mr. Wilson’s inability to hold the
confidence of the people, to win his adversaries
to his standard, to implant himself in the affections
of the mass, cannot be attributed to anything
in our political system but wholly to his
own nature. It is one of the ironies of our political
life that a man like Mr. McKinley, without
distinguished courage, originality, or constructive
genius, is able, through the possession of
minor qualities that are social rather than
political, to endear himself to the great body of
his countrymen. It may be, after all our prayers
for great men, that negative rather than positive
qualities are the safest attributes of a President.</p>

<p>It may fairly be said that Mr. Wilson is intellectually
the equal of most of his predecessors
in the presidency, and the superior of a very
considerable number of them. The very consciousness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
of the perfect functioning of his
own mental machinery made him intolerant of
stupidity, and impatient of the criticism of
those with whom it has been necessary for him
to do his work, who have, so to put it, only
asked to be “shown.” If the disagreeable business
of working in practical politics in all its
primary branches serves no better purpose, it
at least exercises a humanizing effect; it is one
way of learning that men must be reasoned
with and led, not driven. In escaping the usual
political apprenticeship, Mr. Wilson missed
wholly the liberalizing and broadening contacts
common to the practical politician. At
times—for example, when the Adamson Law
was passed—I heard Republicans, with unflattering
intonation, call him the shrewdest
politician of his time; but nothing could be
farther from the truth. Nominally the head
of his party, and with its future prosperity in
his hands, he has shown a curious indifference
to the maintenance of its morale.</p>

<p>“Produce great men; the rest follows.” The
production of great men is not so easy as Whitman
imagined; but in eight tremendous years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
we must ruefully confess that no new and commanding
figure has risen in either branch of
Congress. Partisanship constantly to the fore,
but few manifestations of statesmanship: such
is the record. It is well-nigh unbelievable that,
where the issues have so constantly touched
the very life of the nation, the discussions could
have been so marked by narrowness and
bigotry. The exercise of autocratic power by a
group pursuing a policy of frustration and obstruction
is as little in keeping with the spirit
of our institutions as a stubborn, uncompromising
course on the part of the executive. The
conduct of the Republican majority in the
Senate is nothing of which their party can be
proud.</p>

<p>Four years ago I published some reflections
on the low state to which the public service
had fallen, and my views have not been changed
by more recent history. It would be manifestly
unfair to lay at Mr. Wilson’s door the inferiority
of the men elected to the Congress; but with all
the potentialities of party leadership and his singular
felicity of appeal, he has done little to
quicken the public conscience with respect to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
choice of administrators or representatives. It
may be said in his defense that his hours from
the beginning were too crowded to permit such
excursions in political education; but we had a
right to expect him to lend the weight of his
authoritative voice and example to the elevation
of the tone of the public service. Poise
and serenity of temper we admire, but not to
the point where it seemingly vanishes into
indifference and a callousness to criticism. The
appeal two years ago for a Democratic Congress,
that the nation’s arm might be strengthened
for the prosecution of the war, was a gratuitous
slap at the Republican representatives
who had supported his war policies, and an
affront to the public intelligence, that met with
just rebuke. The cavalier discharge of Lansing
and the retention of Burleson show an equally
curious inability to grasp public opinion.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>The whole handling of the League of Nations
was bungled, as most of the Democrats
I know privately admit. The end of a war that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
had shaken the very foundations of the earth
was a fitting time to attempt the formation
of an association of the great powers to enforce
the peaceful settlement of international
disputes. Here was a matter that spoke powerfully
to the conscience and the imagination,
and in the chastened mood of a war-weary
world it seemed a thing possible of achievement.
Certainly, in so far as America was concerned,
it was a project to be approached in
such manner that its success could in no way
be jeopardized by partisanship. The possibility
of opposition by Democratic senators, the
hostility of Republican senators, which was
not merely partisan but in certain quarters
tinged with bitter personal hatred of the President,
was to be anticipated and minimized.</p>

<p>The President’s two trips abroad were a
mistake, at least in that they encouraged those
of his critics who assailed him as an autocrat
and supreme egotist stubbornly bent upon
doing the whole business in his own way. The
nation was entitled to the services in the peace
negotiations of its best talent—men strongly
established in public confidence. Mr. Wilson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
paid dearly for his inability to recognize this.
His own appearance at Versailles conveyed a
false impression of his powers, and the effect
at home was to cause uneasiness among many
who had most cordially supported him.</p>

<p>The hovering figure of Colonel House has
been a constant irritation to a public uninformed
as to the training or experience that
set him apart for preferment. In sending from
the homebound ship an invitation to the august
Foreign Relations committee to gather at the
White House at an hour appointed and hear
the good news that a league was in prospect,
the President once more displayed a lamentable
ignorance of human nature. His attitude was a
trifle too much like that of a parent returning
from a journey and piquing the curiosity of his
household by a message conveying the glad
tidings that he was bringing presents for their
delight. There are one hundred millions of us,
and we are not to be managed in this way.</p>

<p>Colonel Roosevelt might have done precisely
these things and “got away with it.” Many
thousands would have said it was just like him,
and applauded. The effect of Mr. Wilson’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
course was to precipitate a prolonged battle
over the league and leave it high in the air.
It hovers over the present campaign like a toy
balloon floating within reach of languid and
indifferent spectators. In that part of the country
with whose feelings and temper on public
matters I may pretend to some knowledge, I
do not believe that any one cares greatly about
it. The moment it became a partisan question,
it lost its vitality as a moral issue that promised
peace and security to America and all the world.
Our attitude with respect to the league has
added nothing to the nation’s dignity; rather,
by our wabbly course in this matter we have
done much to weaken the case for world democracy.
Its early acceptance, with reservations
that would have stilled the cry of denationalization,
would have made it an achievement
on which the Democratic party might have
gone to the people with satisfaction and confidence.
Even considered as an experiment of
dubious practicability, it would have been
defensible at least as an honest attempt to
blunt the sword of the war god. The spirit in
which we associated ourselves with the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
powers that resisted the Kaiser’s attempt to
bestride the world like a Colossus needed for
its complete expression the further effort to
make a repetition of the gigantic struggle impossible.</p>

<p>As a people we are strongly aroused and
our imagination quickened by anything that
may be viewed in a glow of spirituality; and a
scheme of peace insurance already in operation
would have proved a dangerous thing to attack.
But the league’s moral and spiritual aspects
have been marred or lost. The patience
of the people has been exhausted by the long
debate about it, and the pettiness and insincerity,
the contemptible evasion and hair-splitting,
that have marked the controversy
over what is, in its purpose and aim, a crystallization
of the hope of mankind in all the ages.
Such a league might fail; certainly its chance
of success is vastly decreased by America’s
refusal to participate.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>In the cool airs of the North Smith and I
have honestly tried to reduce the league situation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
to intelligible terms. Those voters who
may feel constrained to regard the election as
a referendum of the league will do well to follow
our example in pondering the speeches of
acceptance of the two candidates. Before these
words are read both Governor Cox and Senator
Harding will doubtless have amplified their
original statements, but these are hardly susceptible
of misinterpretation as they stand.
Mr. Harding’s utterance is in effect a motion
to lay on the table, to defer action to a more
convenient season, and take it up <i>de novo</i>. Governor
Cox, pledging his support to the proposition,
calls for the question. Mr. Harding defines
his position thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>With a Senate advising, as the Constitution contemplates,
I would hopefully approach the nations of Europe
and of the earth, proposing that understanding which
makes us a willing participant in the consecration of nations
to a new relationship, to commit the moral forces
of the world, America included, to peace and international
justice, still leaving America free, independent,
and self-reliant, but offering friendship to all the world.</p>

<p>If men call for more specific details, I remind them
that moral committals are broad and all-inclusive, and
we are contemplating peoples in the concord of humanity’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
advancement. From our own view-point the programme
is specifically American, and we mean to be American
first, to all the world.</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Cox says, “I favor going in”; and meets
squarely the criticism that the Democratic
platform is not explicit as to reservations. He
would “state our interpretations of the Covenant
as a matter of good faith to our associates
and as a precaution against any misunderstanding
in the future,” and quotes from an
article of his own, published in the New York
<i>Times</i> before his nomination, these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In giving its assent to this treaty, the Senate has in
mind the fact that the League of Nations which it embodies
was devised for the sole purpose of maintaining
peace and comity among the nations of the earth and
preventing the recurrence of such destructive conflicts
as that through which the world has just passed. The
co-operation of the United States with the league, and
its continuance as a member thereof, will naturally depend
upon the adherence of the league to that fundamental
purpose.</p>
</div>

<p>He proposes an addition to the Covenant
of some such paragraph as this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It will, of course, be understood that, in carrying out
the purpose of the league, the government of the United<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
States must at all times act in strict harmony with the
terms and intent of the United States Constitution, which
cannot in any way be altered by the treaty-making power.</p>
</div>

<p>There is no echo here of the President’s uncompromising
declaration that the Covenant
must be accepted precisely as he presented it.
To the lay mind there is no discernible difference
between a reservation and an interpretation,
when the sole purpose in either case would
be to make it clear to the other signatories,
through the text of the instrument itself, that
we could bind ourselves in no manner that
transcended the Constitution.</p>

<p>Smith is endowed with a talent for condensation,
and I cheerfully quote the result of his
cogitations on the platforms and the speeches
of the candidates. “The Republican senators
screamed for reservations, but when Hiram
Johnson showed symptoms of kicking out of the
traces they pretended that they never wanted
the league at all. But to save their faces they
said maybe some time when the sky was high
and they were feeling good they would shuffle
the deck and try a new deal. Cox is for playing
the game right through on the present layout.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
If you’re keen for the League of Nations, your
best chance of ever seeing America sign up is
to stand on Cox’s side of the table.”</p>

<p>Other Smiths, not satisfied with his analysis,
and groping in the dark, may be grateful for
the leading hand of Mr. Taft. The former President
was, in his own words, “one of the small
group who, in 1915, began the movement in
this country for the League of Nations and
the participation of the United States therein.”
Continuing, he said, in the Philadelphia <i>Ledger</i>
of August 1:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Had I been in the Senate, I would have voted for the
league and treaty as submitted; and I advocated its
ratification accordingly. I did not think and do not now
think that anything in the League Covenant as sent to
the Senate would violate the Constitution of the United
States, or would involve us in wars which it would not
be to the highest interest of the world and this country
to suppress by universal boycott and, if need be, by military
force.</p>
</div>

<p>In response to a question whether, this being
his feeling, he would not support Mr. Cox,
Mr. Taft made this reply:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>No such issue as the ratification of the League of Nations
as submitted can possibly be settled in the coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
election. Only one-third of the Senate is to be elected,
and but fifteen Republican senators out of forty-nine
can be changed. There remain in the Senate, whatever
the result of the election, thirty-three Republicans who
have twice voted against the ratification of the league
without the Lodge reservations. Of the fifteen retiring
Republicans, many are certain of re-election. Thirty-three
votes will defeat the league.</p>
</div>

<p>Smith, placidly fishing, made the point that
a man who believed in a thing would vote for
it even though it was a sure loser, and asked
where a Democratic landslide would leave
Mr. Taft. When I reminded him that he had
drifted out of the pellucid waters of political
discussion and snagged the boat on a moral
question, he became peevish and refused to
fish any more that day.</p>

<p>The league is the paramount issue, or it is
not; you can take it, or leave it alone. The
situation may be wholly changed when Mr.
Root, to whom the Republican league plank
is attributed, reports the result of his labors
in organizing the international court of arbitration.
Some new proposal for an association
of nations to promote or enforce peace would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
be of undoubted benefit to the Republicans
in case they find their negative position difficult
to maintain.</p>

<p>The platforms and speeches of acceptance
present, as to other matters, nothing over which
neighbors need quarrel. As to retrenchment,
labor, taxation, and other questions of immediate
and grave concern, the promises of both
candidates are fair enough. They both clearly
realize that we have entered upon a period
that is likely to witness a strong pressure for
modifications of our social and political structure.
Radical sentiment has been encouraged,
or at least tolerated, in a disturbing degree by
the present administration. However, there is
nothing in Mr. Cox’s record as governor or in
his expressed views to sustain any suspicion
that he would temporize with the forces of
destruction. The business of democracy is to
build, not to destroy; to help, not to hinder.
We have from both candidates much the
same assurances of sympathy with the position
held nowadays by all straight-thinking men—that
industrial peace, concord, and contentment
can be maintained only by fair dealing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
and good-will among all of us for the good
of all.</p>

<p>From their public utterances and other testimony
we are not convinced that either candidate
foreshadows a stalwart Saul striding across
the hills on his way to the leadership of Israel.
Mr. Harding shows more poise—more caution
and timidity, if you will; Mr. Cox is a more
alert and forthright figure, far likelier to strike
“straight at the grinning Teeth of Things.”
He is also distinctly less careful of his speech.
He reminds the Republicans that “McKinley
broke the fetters of our boundary lines, spoke
of the freedom of Cuba, and carried the torch
of American idealism to the benighted Philippines”—a
proud boast that must have pained
Mr. Bryan. In the same paragraph of his speech
of acceptance we are told that “Lincoln fought
a war on the purely moral question of slavery”—a
statement that must ring oddly in the ears
of Southerners brought up in the belief that
the South fought in defense of State sovereignty.
These may not be inadvertences, but
a courageous brushing away of old litter; he
is entitled to the benefit of the doubt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span></p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Smith rose from his morning dip with the
joyful countenance of a diver who has found
a rare pearl. We were making progress, he said;
he thought he had got hold of what he called
the God’s truth of the whole business. What
those fellows did at Chicago and San Francisco
was to cut the barbed-wire entanglements in
No Man’s Land, so that it doesn’t make much
difference on which side of the battle-line we
find ourselves on election day. The parties
have unwittingly flung a challenge to the independent
voter. An extraordinary opportunity
is presented to citizens everywhere to scrutinize
with unusual care their local tickets and vote
for the candidates who promise the best service.
As Smith put it, we ought to be able to
scramble things a good deal. Keep the bosses
guessing: this he offered as a good slogan for
the whole Smith family. In our own Indiana
we would pick and choose, registering, of course,
our disapproval of Senator Watson as a post-graduate
of the Penrose school, and voting
for a Democrat for governor because Governor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
Goodrich’s administration has been a continuous
vaudeville of error and confusion, and
the Democratic candidate, a gentleman heretofore
unknown in politics, talks common sense
in folksy language.</p>

<p>We finally concluded as to the presidency
that it came down to a choice of men tested
by their experience, public acts, and the influences
behind them. The imperative demand
is for an efficient administration of the federal
government. The jobs must be given to big
men of demonstrated capacity. Undoubtedly
Mr. Harding would have a larger and more
promising field to draw upon. If it were possible
for Mr. Cox to break a precedent and
state with the frankness of which he seems
capable the order of men he would assemble
for his counsellors and administrators, he would
quiet an apprehension that is foremost in the
minds of an innumerable company of hesitating
voters. Fear of continuance of Mr. Wilson’s
indulgent policy toward mediocrity and a repetition
of his refusal to seek the best help the
nation offered (until compelled to call upon
the expert dollar-a-year man to meet the exigencies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
of war) is not a negligible factor in this
campaign, and Mr. Cox, if he is wise, will not
ignore it.</p>

<p>The manner of Mr. Harding’s nomination
by the senatorial cabal, whose influence upon
his administration is hardly a speculative matter,
invites the consideration of progressive
Republicans who rankle under two defeats
fairly chargeable to reactionary domination.
It was apparent at Chicago that the Old Guard
had learned nothing and would risk a third
consecutive defeat rather than accept any
candidate not of their choosing. Mr. Harding’s
emphasis upon his belief in party government,
as distinguished from personal government—obviously
a slap at Mr. Wilson—is susceptible
of an unfortunate interpretation, as Mr. Cox
was quick to see. If the Republican candidate
means submission to organization chiefs, or to
such a group as now controls the Senate and
the party, his declaration is not reassuring.</p>

<p>If Smith, in his new mood of independence,
votes for Mr. Cox, and I, not a little bitter
that my party in these eight years has failed
to meet my hopes for it, vote for Mr. Harding,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
which of us, I wonder, will the better serve
America?</p>

<p>With renewed faith and hope we packed our
belongings and made ready for our return to
the world of men. Having settled the nation’s
affairs, and being on good terms with our consciences,
we turned for a last look at the camp
before embarking. Smith took the platforms
and the speeches of acceptance of the candidates
for President and Vice-President of the
United States, affixed them firmly to a stone,
and consigned them without ceremony to the
deep. The fish had been naughty, he said, and
he wanted to punish them for their bad manners.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE POOR OLD ENGLISH LANGUAGE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the whole range of human endeavor no
department is so hospitable to the amateur
as education. Here the gates are
always open. Wide is the field and many are
the fools who disport therein.</p>

<p>Politics we are all too prone to forget between
campaigns; literature and the graphic
arts engage only our languid attention and
science interests us only when our imaginations
are mightily stirred. But we all know how the
young idea should be taught to shoot. We are
either reactionaries, lamenting the good old
times of the three <i>r’s</i> and the little red schoolhouse,
or we discuss with much gravity such
weighty problems as the extension or curtailment
of the elective system, or we fly to the
defense or demolition of the ideas of Dewey
and other reformers. It is folly not to hold
opinions where no one is sure of anything and
every one is free to strut in the silken robes of
wisdom. Many of us receive at times flattering
invitations to express opinions touching the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
education of our youth. Though my own schooling
was concluded at the algebra age, owing
to an inherent inability to master that subject
or even comprehend what it was all about, I
have not scrupled to contribute to educational
symposia at every opportunity. Perhaps I
answer the riddles of the earnest critics of education
the more cheerfully from the very fact
of my benightedness. When the doors are closed
and the potent, grave, and reverend signiors
go into committee of the whole to determine
why education does not indeed educate—there,
in such a company, I am not only an eager
listener but, with the slightest encouragement,
I announce and defend my opinions.</p>

<p>Millions are expended every year for the
public enlightenment, and yet no one is satisfied
either with the method or the result. Some
one is always trying to do something for culture.
It seems at times that the efforts of the
women of America to increase the remnant
that is amiably disposed toward sweetness and
light cannot fail, so many and so zealous are
the organizations in which they band themselves
for this laudable purpose. A little while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
ago we had a nation-wide better-English week
to encourage respect among the youth of this
jazzy age for the poor old English language.</p>

<p>I shall express without apology my opinion
that in these free States we are making no
marked headway in the attempt to improve
spoken or written English. Hardly a day passes
that I do not hear graduates of colleges confuse
their pronouns; evil usages are as common as
the newspapers. And yet grammar and rhetoric
are taught more or less intelligently by a vast
army of overworked and underpaid teachers,
according to the text-books fashioned by
specialists who really do try to make themselves
intelligible.</p>

<p>My attitude toward this whole perplexing
business is one of the greatest tolerance. I doubt
seriously whether I could pass an examination
in English grammar. A Japanese waiter in a
club in my town used to lie in wait for me,
when I visited the house at odd hours in search
of seclusion, for the purpose of questioning me
as to certain perplexing problems in grammar.
He had flatteringly chosen me from the club
roster as a lettered person, and it was with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
astonishment that he heard my embarrassed
confession that I shared his bewilderment. To
any expert grammarians who, inspired by this
revelation, begin a laborious investigation of
these pages in pursuit of errors, I can only say
that I wish them good luck in their adventure.
At times I do manifestly stumble, and occasionally
the blunder is grievous. A poem of
my authorship once appeared in a periodical
of the most exacting standards with a singular
noun mated to a plural verb. For proof-readers
as a class I entertain the greatest veneration.
Often a query courteously noted on the margin
of a galley has prevented a violence to my
mother tongue which I would not consciously
inflict upon it.</p>

<p>To add to the fury of the grammar hounds,
I will state that at times in my life I have been
able to read Greek, Latin, Italian, and French
without ever knowing anything about the
grammar of either of these languages beyond
what I worked out for myself as I went along.
This method or lack of method is not, I believe,
original with me, for there are, or have
been, inductive methods of teaching foreign<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
languages which set the student at once to
reading and made something rather incidental
of the grammar. This is precisely what I should
do with English if I were responsible for the
instruction of children at the age when it is
the fashion to begin hammering grammar into
their inhospitable minds. Ignorant of grammar
myself, but having—if I may assume so much—an
intuitive sense of the proper and effective
manner of shaping sentences, there would be
no text-books in my schoolroom. All principals,
trustees, inspectors, and educational reformers
would be excluded from my classes, and I
should insist on protection from physical manifestations
of their indignation on my way to
and from the schoolhouse. The first weeks of
my course would be purely conversational.
I should test the students for their vulgarities
and infelicities, and such instances, registered
on the blackboard, would visualize the errors
as long as necessary. The reading of indubitably
good texts in class would, of course, be part
of the programme, and the Bible I should use
freely, particularly drawing upon the Old Testament
narratives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>I should endeavor to make it appear that
clean and accurate speech is a part of good
manners, an important item in the general
equipment for life. When it came to writing,
I should begin with the familiar letter, leaving
the choice of subject to the student. These
compositions, read in the class, would be criticised,
as far as possible, by the students themselves.
I should efface myself completely as
an instructor and establish the relation of
a fellow-seeker intent upon finding the best
way of saying a thing. If there were usages
that appeared to be common to a neighborhood,
or intrusions of dialect peculiar to a
State or a section, I might search out and describe
their origin, but if they were flavorsome
and truly of the soil I should not discourage
their use. Self-consciousness in these early
years is to be avoided. The weaknesses of the
individual student are only discernible where
he is permitted to speak and write without
timidity.</p>

<p>When a youngster is made to understand
from a concrete example that a sentence is
badly constructed, or that it is marred by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
weak word or a word used out of its true sense,
the rules governing such instances may be
brought to his attention with every confidence
that he will understand their point. My work
would be merely a preparation for the teaching
of grammar, if grammar there must be;
but I should resent such instruction if my successor
failed to relate my work to his.</p>

<p>I consider the memorizing of short passages
of verse and prose an important adjunct to
the teaching of English by any method. “Learn
it by heart” seems to have gone out of fashion
in late years. I have recently sat in classes and
listened to the listless reading, paragraph by
paragraph, of time-honored classics, knowing
well that the students were getting nothing out
of them. The more good English the student carries
in his head the likelier he is to gain a respect
for his language and a confidence and
effectiveness in speaking and writing it.</p>

<p>Let the example precede the rule! If there
is any sense in the rule the example will clarify
it; if it is without justification and designed
merely to befuddle the student, then it ought
to be abolished anyhow. The idea that children<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
should be seen and not heard belongs to
the period when it was believed that to spare
the rod was to spoil the child. Children should
be encouraged to talk, to observe and to describe
the things that interest them in the
course of the day. In this way they will form
the habit of the intelligent reporter who, on
the way to his desk from an assignment, plans
his article, eager to find the best way of telling
his story. Instead of making a hateful mystery
of English speech it should be made the most
natural thing in the world, worthy of the effort
necessary to give it accuracy, ease, and
charm.</p>

<p>The scraps of conversation I overhear every day
in elevators, across counters, on the street,
and in trolley-cars are of a nature to disturb
those who view with complacency the great
treasure we pour into education. The trouble
with our English is that too much is taught
and not enough is learned. The child is stuffed,
not fed. Rules crammed into him for his guidance
in self-expression are imperfectly assimilated.
They never become a part of him. His
first contacts with grammar arouse his hostility,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
and seeing no sense in it he casts it aside with
the disdain he would manifest for a mechanical
toy that refused to work in the manner
promised by the advertisement.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
